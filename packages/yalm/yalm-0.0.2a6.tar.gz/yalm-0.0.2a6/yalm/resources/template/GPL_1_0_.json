By\n       contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n       software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to\n       the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\n       it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public\n       License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\n       software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software\n       or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to\n       ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n       you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\n       recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n       source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which\n       gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that\n       there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\n       on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems\n       introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "0."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n        This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the\n           copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\n           The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on\n           the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of\n           it, either verbatim or with modifications.
