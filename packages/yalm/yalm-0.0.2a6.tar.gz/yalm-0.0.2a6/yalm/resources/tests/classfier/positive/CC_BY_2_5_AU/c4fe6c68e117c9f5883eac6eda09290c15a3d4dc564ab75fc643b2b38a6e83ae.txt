          Definitions
        
            "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
            encyclopaedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
            number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
            themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
            Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the
            purposes of this Licence.
          .xZ8<{C"n \[%q
            "Derivative Work" means a work that reproduces a substantial part of the Work,
            or of the Work and other pre-existing works protected by copyright, or that is an
            adaptation of a Work that is a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.
            Derivative Works include a translation, musical arrangement, dramatisation,
            motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation,
            or any other form in which a work may be adapted, except that a
            work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
            the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
            musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
            with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for
            the purpose of this Licence.

            "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of
            this Licence.
          
            "Moral rights law" means laws under which an individual who creates a work
            protected by copyright has rights of integrity of authorship of the work, rights of
            attribution of authorship of the work, rights not to have authorship of the work
            falsely attributed, or rights of a similar or analogous nature in the work anywhere
            in the world.

          Restrictions. The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited
          by the following restrictions:
          }/%op}R]faT,r
              You may publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display,
              publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
              Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
              Licence with every copy or record of the Work You publish, communicate to the
              public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform or publicly digitally
              perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that exclude, alter or
              restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
              hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
              refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of representations and warranties. You
              may not publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display,
              publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
              measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
              terms of this Licence. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
              Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
              made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon
              notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
              Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create
              a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
              practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section
              4(b), as requested.

              If you publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display,
              publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
              Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work. You must
              also give clear and reasonably prominent credit to (i) the Original Author (by name
              or pseudonym if applicable), if the name or pseudonym is supplied; and (ii) if
              another party or parties (eg a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) is
              designated for attribution in the copyright notice, terms of service or other
              reasonable means associated with the Work, such party or parties. If applicable,
              that credit must be given in the particular way made known by the Original Author
              and otherwise as reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing, by
              conveying the identity of the Original Author and the other designated party or
              parties (if applicable); the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
              practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
              associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
              licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
              identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of
              the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
              Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
              however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
              such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and
              in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
            U
              False attribution prohibited. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
              Licensor, if You publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or
              display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative
              Works or Collective Works in accordance with this Licence, You must not falsely
              attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author.

              Prejudice to honour or reputation prohibited. Except as otherwise agreed in
              writing by the Licensor, if you publish, communicate to the public, distribute,
              publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
              or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must not do anything that results
              in a material distortion of, the mutilation of, or a material alteration to, the Work
              that is prejudicial to the Original Author's honour or reputation, and You must not
              do anything else in relation to the Work that is prejudicial to the Original Author's
              honour or reputation.
