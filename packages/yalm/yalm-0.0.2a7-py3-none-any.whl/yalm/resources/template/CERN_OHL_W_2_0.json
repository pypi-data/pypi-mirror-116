Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: this licence, CERN- OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).\n      The CERN-OHL-W is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only.\n      Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": " Definitions\n          "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1.1"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": " 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-W.\n            "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1.2"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": " 'Compatible Licence' means\n              "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "a)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": " any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or\n                "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "b)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": " any version of the CERN-OHL-S or the CERN-OHL-W, or\n                "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "c)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": " any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which it applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W provided that on Conveyance of any such Source, or any associated Product You treat the Source in question as being licensed under CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W as appropriate.\n            "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1.3"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": " 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital code which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is expressed.
