                        ]2GWZjk@ “Data” means the material you receive under the C-UDA in modified or unmodified form, but not including Results.
                        \7b*#mm\ “Data Provider” means the source from which you receive the Data and with whom you enter into the C-UDA.

Results may include de minimis portions of the Data necessary to report on or explain use that has been conducted with the Data, such as figures in scientific papers, but do not include more. Artificial intelligence models trained on Data (and which do not include more than a de minimis portion of Data) are Results.
