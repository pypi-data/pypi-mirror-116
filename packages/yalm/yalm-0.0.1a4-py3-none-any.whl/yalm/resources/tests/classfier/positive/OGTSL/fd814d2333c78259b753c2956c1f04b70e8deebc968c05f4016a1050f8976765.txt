      "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that
         collection of files created through textual modification.
      "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in
         accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
      "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
      "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
      "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges,
         time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
         but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
      "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
         handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
         conditions they received it.

             that you do at least the following:
          rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard
             executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for
             each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the
