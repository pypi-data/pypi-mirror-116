                    6([9t=?1wXV “Computational Use” means activities necessary to enable the use of Data (alone or along with other material) for analysis by a computer.
                        3T]x= “Data” means the material you receive under the C-UDA in modified or unmodified form, but not including Results.
                        ` “Data Provider” means the source from which you receive the Data and with whom you enter into the C-UDA.
                        `IA4YR|` “Downstream Recipient” means any person or persons who receives the Data directly or indirectly from you in accordance with the C-UDA.
                        > “Result” means anything that you develop or improve from your use of Data that does not include more than a de minimis portion of the Data on which the use is based. Results may include de minimis portions of the Data necessary to report on or explain use that has been conducted with the Data, such as figures in scientific papers, but do not include more. Artificial intelligence models trained on Data (and which do not include more than a de minimis portion of Data) are Results.
                        tKu[uK “Upstream Data Providers” means the source or sources from which the Data Provider directly or indirectly received, under the terms of the C-UDA, material that is included in the Data.
