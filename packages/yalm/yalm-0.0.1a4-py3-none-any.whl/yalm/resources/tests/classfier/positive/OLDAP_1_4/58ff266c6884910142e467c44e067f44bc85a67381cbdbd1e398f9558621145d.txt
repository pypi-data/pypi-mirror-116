      Definitions:
      "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
         derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.
      "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
         in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
      "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
      "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
      "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
      "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
         involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
         same conditions they received it.
      52mt5n,;vNbJu(iD:N9r
          You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this
             Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices
             and associated disclaimers.
        qV1q
          You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain
             or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
             Standard Version.

          You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a
             prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided
             that you do at least ONE of the following:

               as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the

               Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

               which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard
               executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

          You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any
             fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
             However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
             programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do
             not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

          The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of

             this Package may be used and redistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially so
             long as the primary function of your software is different than the package itself.
