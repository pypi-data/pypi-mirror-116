            "Convey" - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the
             Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive
             copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a
             user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a
             copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.
             "Contents" - The

             material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be
             factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.
            "Database" - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or
             methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the

             the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or
             succeeded.
            "Database Right" - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ("sui
             generis") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member
             states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part
             of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under
             Section 10.4.
            "Derivative Database" - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes
             any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the
             Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to,
             Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new
             Database.
            "Extraction" - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial
             part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.
            "License" - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as

             other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a
             Collective Database.
            "Publicly" - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either
             more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with

            "Re-utilisation" - means any form of making available to the public all or a
             Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other
             forms of transmission.

             combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial
             parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of
             the Contents.
            "Use" - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or
             Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation

             previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has
             received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
             previous violation.

            A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;
               MQ['+z<X0)_a{[|y"<8d

          Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database, including:
        $^6
            Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed
               includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over
               the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law
               varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which
               is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the
               Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names
               of Contents stored in the Database;
               u*f-W8yaHaz#*(R[
            Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the
               whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is
               no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are
               removed from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe
               any applicable copyright; and
               wj!u
            Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the Database. In
               return you agree to certain conditions of use on this access as outlined in this
               License.

            This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database;
               !3[%iHA~
            This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database; and

          Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the Contents contained in this
             Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection,
             privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than
             Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example,
             if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over
             individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license
             covering all of the rights over the images.

             royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database
             for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
             include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in
             the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
             known or created in the future.
          The rights granted cover, for example:

          Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:
        ]`.9^B9Ru
            Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect
               royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
               Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
               the rights granted under this License;

            Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect
               royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
               waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
               granted under this License; and,
               kiNx>ln#Z
            Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
               individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
               administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the
               rights granted under this License.

          The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making
             available the Database, is reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so
             You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section
             10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.

          The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with the
             following conditions of use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You fail
             to follow them, You will be in material breach of its terms.

          Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part
             of a Collective Database, then You must:
        L|XSbZ3PGy=(rw
            Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted under Section 4.4;
               8f_d.A
            Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted under Section 4.4) or
               its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including
               both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and
               GX1:7QV1w&\al_#
            Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License.

            If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure,
               then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users
               would be likely to look for it.

          Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does not require the
             notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice
             associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views,
             accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was
             obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective
             Database, and that it is available under this License.

               License (ODbL).
                  DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the URI of
               the Database. "Open Database License" should contain a hyperlink to the URI of
               the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain

              This License;
                     
              A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or

              A compatible license.
              If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses mentioned in (iii), You
                 must comply with the terms of that license.

            For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part
               of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative Database and must comply with Section
               4.4.

            Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is Publicly Used and so must
               comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work created from the Derivative Database is
               Publicly Used.

            Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must not add Contents to
               Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are incompatible with the rights granted
               under this License.

            Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine compatible licenses under
               Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the authorised proxy's public statement of
               acceptance of a compatible license grants You permission to use the compatible
               license.

          Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in the following:
        	+,La+
            For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective Databases under this
               License if You incorporate this Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but
               this License still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of the
               Collective Database;

            Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database
               to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative Database for purposes of Section
               4.4; and

            Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to the public and
               therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section 4.4.

          Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative Database or a Produced Work from
             a Derivative Database, You must also offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or

             any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and
             conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
             with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database.
             You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You or

          Moral rights

          Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the
             author of the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the
             author's honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment:

               moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under
               Section 10.4; and

            For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under
               Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the
               Database.
            Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral
               rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions.
