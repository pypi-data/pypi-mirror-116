Such a\n          notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in\n          duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.\n          The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work.\n          Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as\n          \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute\n          the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n        A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing\n          the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or\n          with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n        A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter\n          section of the Document that deals exclusively with the\n          relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the\n          Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains\n          nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.\n          (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\n          a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The\n          relationship could be a matter of historical connection with\n          the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\n          philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n        The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose\n          titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,\n          in the notice that says that the Document is released under\n          this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of\n          Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.\n          The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\n          does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n        The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\n          as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\n          the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may\n          be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n        A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable\n          copy, represented in a format whose specification is available\n          to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document\n          straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\n          pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\n          drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\n          for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\n          to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\n          format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\n          or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\n          An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial\n          amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n        Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n          ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,\n          SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\n          simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.\n          Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.\n          Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read\n          and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML\n          for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally\n          available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF\n          produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n        The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n          plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the\n          material this License requires to appear in the title page. For\n          works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title\n          Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the\n          work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n        The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that\n          distributes copies of the Document to the public.\n        A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\n          title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\n          text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for\n          a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\n          \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the\n          Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that\n          it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n        The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\n          which states that this License applies to the Document.

Copying with changes limited to the covers, as\n          long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\n          conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n        If the required texts for either cover are too\n          voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first\n          ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n          cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n        If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n          numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\n          Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with\n          each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\n          network-using public has access to download using public-standard\n          network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\n          free of added material.
