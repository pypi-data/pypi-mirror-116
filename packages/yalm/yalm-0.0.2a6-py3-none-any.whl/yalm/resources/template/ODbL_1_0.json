Many databases are covered by\n         copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the\n         European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights,\n         too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain\n         ways in return for accessing this Database.\n         Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in\n         the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not\n         the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license\n         for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the\n         contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what\n         rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what\n         rights apply.\n         Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not\n         addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data\n         protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to\n         consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.\n         ------"}]}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n      The Licensor (as defined below)\n      and\n      You (as defined below)\n      agree as follows:\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1.0"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          Definitions of Capitalised Words\n          \"Collective Database\" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a\n             collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a\n             collective whole.
