          Redistributions in any form must be accompanied by information on how to obtain complete source
             code for the DB software and any accompanying software that uses the DB software. The source
             code must either be included in the distribution or be available for no more than the cost of
             distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable
             conditions. For an executable file, complete source code means the source code for all modules
             it contains. It does not include source code for modules or files that typically accompany the
             major components of the operating system on which the executable file runs.
