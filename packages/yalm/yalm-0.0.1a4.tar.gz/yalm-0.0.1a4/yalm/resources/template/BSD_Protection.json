For\n         programmers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is\n         arguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used\n         wherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.\n         This is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: The\n         case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the\n         rapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network\n         models).\n         With the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the\n         continued success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion of a few lines of\n         \"GPL-tainted\" work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and\n         given that further work will likely build upon the \"tainted\" portions, making them difficult\n         to remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to\n         protect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such\n         \"GPL-taint\".\n         In addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling (possibly\n         closed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.\n         While under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license,\n         if a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own\n         (commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.\n         For the above reasons, we put forth this \"BSD Protection License\": A license designed to retain\n         the freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both\n         non-commercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that\n         freedom.\n         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow."}}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n      BSD PROTECTION LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION\n      "}, {"type": "optional", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "----------------------------------------------------------------"}}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "0."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          Definitions.\n        "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "a)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            \"Program\", below, refers to any program or work distributed under the terms of this\n               license.\n            "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "b)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            A \"work based on the Program\", below, refers to either the Program or any\n               derivative work under copyright law.\n            "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "c)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            \"Modification\", below, refers to the act of creating derivative works.\n            "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "d)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            \"You\", below, refers to each licensee.\n        "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          Scope.\n            This license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of the Program.
