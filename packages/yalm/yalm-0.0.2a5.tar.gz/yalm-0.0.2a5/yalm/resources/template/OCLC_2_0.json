The requirements of Section\n           3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to such distributions.\n            An \"Aggregate Work\" is when the Program exists, without integration, with other programs on a storage medium.\n           This License does not apply to portions of an Aggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of\n           \"Program\" provided in this License. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the\n           Program contained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this License. Also, should the Program be extracted\n           from an Aggregate Work, this License applies to any use of the Program apart from the Aggregate Work.\n            Section 4. License Grant\n            For purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees hereunder, you hereby grant\n           to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable\n           license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, enhance, develop, publicly\n           display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works based on your Modifications\n           (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section 4 shall survive termination of\n           this License for any reason.\n      Section 5. Termination of Rights\n      This non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) automatically terminates\n       for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with respect to the\n       Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\n      If you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this License shall\n       terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the\n       noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are properly granted\n       shall survive such termination.\n      Section 6. Other Terms\n      Except for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of the Contributors\n       without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure\n       any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program.\n      All transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. import/export\n       regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other similar trade or\n       commerce restrictions which might apply.\n      Any patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a provision providing\n       for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any third party.\n      If, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property infringement or any\n       other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, such\n       conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot distribute the Program so as\n       to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other conditions, you may not\n       distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\n       redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, you\n       could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain entirely\n       from distribution of the Program.\n      If you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already distributed\n       you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to inform those\n       who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable step to inform would\n       be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board.\n      The provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any\n       provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and\n       effect. In substitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar\n       import reflecting the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\n      The Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended license will apply to all\n       copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License grants only the rights\n       expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual property\n       of any Contributor.\n      This License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties concerning the\n       subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of the parties. This License\n       shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the United States\n       of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law."}]
