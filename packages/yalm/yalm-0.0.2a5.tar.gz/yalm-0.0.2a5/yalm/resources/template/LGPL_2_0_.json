It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2\n         of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n      \nPreamble\n\n      \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By\n         contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n         free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n      \nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software\n         Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for\n         your libraries, too.\n\n      \nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are\n         designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n         this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can\n         change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these\n         things.\n\n      \nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to\n         ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n         you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n      \nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\n         recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n         source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\n         recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and\n         recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n      \nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this\n         license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n      \nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that\n         there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on,\n         we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems\n         introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\n      \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\n         companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n         transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n         patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n      \nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which\n         was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to\n         certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read\n         it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\n      \nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we\n         usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a\n         library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to\n         running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked\n         executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public\n         License treats it as such.\n\n      \nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not\n         effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded\n         that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n      \nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all\n         benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is\n         intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your\n         freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We\n         have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as\n         regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster\n         development of free libraries.\n\n      \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention\n         to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the\n         library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together\n         with the library.\n\n      \nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than\n         by this special one.\n\n      \nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "0."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the\n             copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n             this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is\n             addressed as \"you\".\n          \nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be\n             conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to\n             form executables.\n\n            \nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\n             distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the\n             Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n             Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n             straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\n             limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n            \n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\n             to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it\n             contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n             compilation and installation of the library.\n\n            \nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\n             they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted,\n             and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n             Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true\n             depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n        \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\n             receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\n             copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\n             that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this\n             License along with the Library.\n          \nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option\n             offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n        \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "2."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based\n             on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n             1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n        "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "a)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            The modified work must itself be a software library.\n               \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "b)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the\n               files and the date of any change.\n               \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "c)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under\n               the terms of this License.\n               \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "d)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied\n               by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when\n               the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the\n               event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\n               and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n            \n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely\n               well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n               application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the\n               application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square\n               roots.)\n            \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
