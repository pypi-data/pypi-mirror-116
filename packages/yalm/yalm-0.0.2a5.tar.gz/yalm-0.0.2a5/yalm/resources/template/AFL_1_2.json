Licensor hereby grants to any person obtaining a copy of the Original Work (\"You\") a\n         world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license (1) to use, copy,\n         modify, merge, publish, perform, distribute and/or sell copies of the Original Work and derivative\n         works thereof, and (2) under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in\n         the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original\n         Work and derivative works thereof, subject to the following conditions.\n\n      \nAttribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all\n         copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any\n         notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must\n         cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice\n         reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n\n      \nExclusions from License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the\n         Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote\n         products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor.\n\n      \nWarranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work is\n         owned by the Licensor or that the Original Work is distributed by Licensor under a valid current\n         license from the copyright owner. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence,\n         the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either\n         express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\n         or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH\n         YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original\n         Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\n\n      \nLimitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\n         negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,\n         indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this\n         License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,\n         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.\n         This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n         Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do\n         not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and\n         limitation may not apply to You.\n\n      \nLicense to Source Code. The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making\n         modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor\n         hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each\n         copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this\n         obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\n         reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as\n         Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that\n         information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to\n         the Original Work.\n\n      \nMutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer\n         exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging\n         that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any license containing this \"Mutual\n         Termination for Patent Action\" clause infringes any patent claims that are essential to use that\n         software.\n\n      \nRight to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this\n         License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by\n         You.\n\n      \nThis license is Copyright (C) 2002 Lawrence E.
