                               reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

                    Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and
                     must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
                     subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
                     requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the
                     alterations made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
                     alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for
                     example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
                     from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not
                     thereafter be revoked.

                     permission of the Contributor who added the notice.

                     obtain commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior

                     do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other
                     Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
                     indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such
                     Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability

                     such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the

                     from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal
