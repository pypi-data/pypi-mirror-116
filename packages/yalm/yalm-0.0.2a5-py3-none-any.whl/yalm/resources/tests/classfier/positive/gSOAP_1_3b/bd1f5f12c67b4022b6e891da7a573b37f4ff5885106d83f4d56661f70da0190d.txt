                         set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different

                        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
                         apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must
                         (a) rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly
                         similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that you license differs
                         from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
                         contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the
                         Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
