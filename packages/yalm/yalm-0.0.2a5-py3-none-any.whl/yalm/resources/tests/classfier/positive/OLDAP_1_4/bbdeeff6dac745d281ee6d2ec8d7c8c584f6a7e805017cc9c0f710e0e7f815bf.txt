      Definitions:
      "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
         derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.
      "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
         in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
      "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
      "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
      "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
      "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
         involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
         same conditions they received it.

             and associated disclaimers.

             long as the primary function of your software is different than the package itself.
