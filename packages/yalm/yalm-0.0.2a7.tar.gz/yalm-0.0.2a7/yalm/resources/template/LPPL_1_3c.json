If you do not see how to\n         achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and\n         `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n      DEFINITIONS\n        ===========\n      In this license document the following terms are used:\n      `Work' Any work being distributed under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any\n         applicable law is derived from the Work.\n      `Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example,\n         the production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion\n         of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n      `Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law.\n         `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in\n         part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work\n         accessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's\n         Network File System (NFS).\n      `Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly\n         usable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the\n         Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that\n         modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the\n         Work.\n      `Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such\n         explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.\n      `Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part\n         or the whole of the Work.\n      A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base\n         Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\n         interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable\n         Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the `LaTeX-format'\n         a program implementing the `TeX language'.\n      CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n        ===========================================\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this\n             license; they are outside its scope.

These authors are addressed as `you' in\n         this section.\n      Choosing This License or Another License\n        ----------------------------------------\n      If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly\n         from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\n         distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for\n         your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\n         your work is distributed under the LPPL.\n      The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the\n         conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General\n         Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the\n         discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their\n         works under any license are encouraged to read it.\n      A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n        -----------------------------------------------------\n      It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting\n         the above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such\n         modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you\n         have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\n         version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that\n         could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in\n         your best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide\n         ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components.\n      How to Use This License\n        -----------------------\n      To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice\n         including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include\n         also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the\n         conditions in this license.\n      Here is an example of such a notice and statement:\n      "}, {"type": "optional", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "%%"}}, {"type": "text", "content": " "}, {"type": "var", "name": "filename", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "pig.dtx"}, "pattern": ".+"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n        "}, {"type": "optional", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "%%"}}, {"type": "text", "content": " Copyright "}, {"type": "var", "name": "copyright", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "2005 M.

Y. Name'.\n      If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above\n         into `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the\n         Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even\n         when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.\n      Derived Works That Are Not Replacements\n        ---------------------------------------\n      Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community.\n         They therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a\n         (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few\n         lines of code are reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\n      Important Recommendations\n        -------------------------\n      Defining What Constitutes the Work\n      The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore\n         important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This\n         could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright\n         notice of each file or by using a line such as:\n      % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n      in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine\n         what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to\n         make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work."}]
