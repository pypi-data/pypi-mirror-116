While this license is intended to facilitate the\n         commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial\n         product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other\n         Contributors.

The obligations in this section\n         do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n         infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the\n         Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n         control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related\n         settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its\n         own expense.\n      For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.\n         That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes\n         performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\n         warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,\n         the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related\n         to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n         pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "5."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n      NO WARRANTY\n      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n         BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,\n         WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\n         OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
