It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library\n         Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\n\n      \nPreamble\n\n      \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By\n         contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n         free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n      \nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software\n         packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.\n         You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the\n         ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the\n         explanations below.\n\n      \nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public\n         Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\n         (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it;\n         that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\n         that you can do these things.\n\n      \nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or\n         to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\n         if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n      \nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\n         recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n         source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\n         recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and\n         recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n      \nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this\n         license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n      \nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free\n         library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n         that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will\n         not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\n      \nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make\n         sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive\n         license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of\n         the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n      \nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This\n         license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite\n         different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order\n         to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\n      \nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of\n         the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\n         General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria\n         of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n         the library.\n\n      \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the\n         user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software\n         developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason\n         we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\n         advantages in certain special circumstances.\n\n      \nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a\n         certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n         allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely\n         used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n         software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n      \nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of\n         people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n         non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its\n         variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\n      \nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\n         that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n         that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n      \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention\n         to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the\n         library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined\n         with the library in order to run.\n\n      \nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n      "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "0."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice\n             placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under\n             the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each\n             licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n          \nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be\n             conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to\n             form executables.\n\n            \nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\n             distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the\n             Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n             Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n             straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\n             limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n            \n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\n             to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it\n             contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n             compilation and installation of the library.\n\n            \nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\n             they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted,\n             and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n             Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true\n             depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n        \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "1."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\n             receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\n             copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\n             that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this\n             License along with the Library.\n          \nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option\n             offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n        \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "2."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based\n             on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n             1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n        "}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "a)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            The modified work must itself be a software library.\n               \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "b)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the\n               files and the date of any change.\n               \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "c)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under\n               the terms of this License.\n               \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "d)"}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n            If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied\n               by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when\n               the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the\n               event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\n               and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n            \n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely\n               well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n               application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the\n               application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square\n               roots.)\n\n            \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

But when you distribute the same\n               sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the\n               whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend\n               to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n            \nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work\n               written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the\n               distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n\n            \nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or\n               with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not\n               bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n        \n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": {"type": "text", "content": "3."}, "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n          You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License\n             to a given copy of the Library.
