class Attck(object):

    """Interface to all MITRE ATT&CK frameworks.

    Currently, this class enables access to the Enterprise & PRE-ATT&CK
    frameworks with others coming soon.  To acccess each framework, use
    the following properties

        * enterprise
        * preattack

    This interface enables you to retrieve all properties within each
    item in the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Framework.

    The following categorical items can be accessed using this class:

        1. Tactics (Tactics are the phases defined by MITRE ATT&CK)
        2. Techniques (Techniques are the individual actions which can
            accomplish a tactic)
        3. Mitigations (Mitigations are recommendations to prevent or
            protect against a technique)
        4. Actors (Actors or Groups are identified malicious
            actors/groups which have been identified and documented by
            MITRE & third-parties)
        5. Tools (Tools are software used to perform techniques)
        6. Malwares (Malwares are specific pieces of malware used by
            actors (or in general) to accomplish a technique)

    You can also search the external dataset for external commands that
    are similar using the `search_commands` method.

        .. code-block:: python

            from pyattck import Attck

            attck = Attck()

            for search in attck.enterprise.search_commands('powershell'):
                print(search['technique'])
                print(search['reason_for_match'])

    Additionally, as of pyattck 2.0.0 you can now access additional
    datasets related to a technique. These datasets are
    [documented here](https://github.com/swimlane/pyattck/blob/master/generateattcks/README.md).

    Example:
        Once an Attck object is instantiated, you can access each object
        type as a list of objects (e.g. techniques, tactics, actors, etc.)

        You can iterate over each object list and access specific properties
        and relationship properties of each.

        The following relationship properties are accessible:
            1. Actors
                1. Tools used by the Actor or Group
                2. Malware used by the Actor or Group
                3. Techniques this Actor or Group uses
            2. Malwares
                1. Actor or Group(s) using this malware
                2. Techniques this malware is used with
            3. Mitigations
                1. Techniques related to a specific set of mitigation suggestions
            4. Tactics
                1. Techniques found in a specific Tactic (phase)
            5. Techniques
                1. Tactics a technique is found in
                2. Mitigation suggestions for a given technique
                3. Actor or Group(s) identified as using this technique
            6. Tools
                1. Techniques that the specified tool is used within
                2. Actor or Group(s) using a specified tool

            1. To iterate over a list, do the following:

            .. code-block:: python

               from pyattck import Attck

               attck = Attck()

               for technique in attck.enterprise.techniques:
                   print(technique.id)
                   print(technique.name)
                   print(technique.description)
                   # etc.
               for mitigation in attck.enterprise.mitigations:
                   print(mitigation.id)
                   print(mitigation.name)
                   print(mitigation.description)
                   # etc.

            2. To access relationship properties, do the following:

            .. code-block:: python

               from pyattck import Attck

               attck = Attck()

        The main entry point for pyattck.

        When instantiating an Attck object you can specify if you want the
        new subtechniques to be nested underneath their parent techniques
        or not.

        Setting nested_subtechniques to False will result in all techniques
        accessible under the techniques property. If using the default value
        of True, subtechniques will be accessible underneath
        technique.subtechniques.

        When instantiating an Attck object you can access either the
        Enterprise, PRE-ATT&CK, or Mobile MITRE Frameworks.  Specify
        one of the following properties to access the frameworks specific
        data:

            * enterprise
            * preattack
            * mobile
