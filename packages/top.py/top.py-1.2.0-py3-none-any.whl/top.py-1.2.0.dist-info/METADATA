An alternative wrapper for the [top.gg API](//docs.top.gg)

_Please note, this is **not an official package from top.gg**. We are not
affiliated with top.gg in any way. If you want to install their official
package, please see [their repo](//github.com/top-gg/python-sdk)._

## Introduction

top.py is a python wrapper for the top.gg discord bot list API. top.py aims to
be object-oriented, whereas the official top.gg python SDK is more low-level raw
data.

**NOTE:** We do **NOT** currently provide official support for discord server
list. That's coming soon.

### Why use top.py over top.gg's sdk?

It's entirely up to your personal preference. But here's a few differences
between this and the official sdk:

- top.py is object-oriented - this means everything has a class, meaning no
  fiddling with raw data values from top.gg.
- top.py is more humanised - top.py is designed with ease of use in mind, so you
  may find there is a smoother experience implementing this than top.gg's sdk.

Just try it, you can choose what you like.

Also, while we try to be our own package, you may notice we've aliased a few
classes, functions and behavious to act like top.gg's sdk. This is mainly so you
have an easier experience migrating, and it's less headache.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release here:

```shell
pip install top.py
```

But, if you're reading this, you're most likely a developer - you should know
how to install packages by now.
