#### Future plans for realization

1. Multiline strings with """ operator (currently only single string lines are supported)
2. Auto-wrapping everything in locals() with @nip
5. \_\_init\_\_ wrapper for convenient object dumping (currently object dumping is not supported. only config dumping)
6. Multi document parsing.
8. List node as an iterable node (currently only simple python-lists are supported for iterators)
9. python code inserts with in-scope
10. strict parser: check typing and reloading dict keys
