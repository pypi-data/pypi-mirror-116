Description: Python client for Tair
        ======================
        
           tairClient is still being developed. Please do not use it for any
           mission critical purpose at this time.
        
        tairClient-py is a package that gives developers easy access to tair or
        tairModules. Tair is a redis-like Key/Value structure data storage
        system independently developed by Alibaba. It has added many powerful
        modules which also can load by redis such as tairHash, tairString, etc.
        
        The package extends
        `redis-py’s <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`__ interface with
        Tair’s API.
