Description: #  Py-Trie
        
        Py-Trie is a command-line interface which enables communication with a global trie hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. Users can execute basic commands such as inserting, deleting, and searching words in the trie. A list of matching words can be generated through an input prefix. Users are also able to display the words present in the trie.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        
        The following are required to be installed on your system before using Py-Trie:
        
        * Python 3.8 or higher
        * Pip
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install Py-Trie, run the following command:
        
        ```
        pip install py-trie
        ```
        
        ## Testing Suite
        
        There are several test cases that can be found in the `test.py` file located in the `cli/pytrie` folder. These tests execute the commands listed in the Usage section. Some tests also simulate multiple users sending requests to the server by running processes on different threads.
        
        To run all the test cases with the trie, run:
        
        ```
        pytrie test
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are 5 basic commands that can be executed using Py-Trie:
        * Insert
        * Remove
        * Search
        * Autocomplete
        * Display
        
        To get a list of all possible commands, run:
        
        ```
        pytrie --help
        ```
        
        ### Insert
        
        To insert a word:
        
        ```
        pytrie insert [WORD]
        ```
        
        ### Remove
        
        To remove a word:
        
        ```
        pytrie remove [WORD]
        ```
        
        ### Search
        
        To search a word:
        
        ```
        pytrie search [WORD]
        ```
        
        ### Autocomplete
        
        To generate a list of matching words based on a prefix:
        
        ```
        pytrie autocomplete [PREFIX]
        ```
        
        ### Display
        
        To display all existing words in the trie:
        
        ```
        pytrie display
        ```
