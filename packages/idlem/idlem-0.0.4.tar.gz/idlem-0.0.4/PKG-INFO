        # TODO:
        [x] pass `hostname` as rigname for pool  
        [ ] validate scheduler for all days at startup  
        [ ] make sure scripts starts after restart  
        [ ] check ps time for all user login shells and start mining if some shells are very old. Sometimes people just forget to detach old shells and they can stay active for weeks  
        [x] allow padding users white list through CLI  
        [x] make adjusting for free GPUs optional (or make it smarter and remember which GPUs were already allocated). Implemented a version which remembers. now it doesn't restart if some gpus are off due to temp limit
