SymDet
------

A python package to perform symmetry detection and generator extraction on
raw data. Follows the paper by Sven Krippendorf and Marc Syvaeri on
`Detecting symmetries with neural networks <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abbd2d>`_.

Notes
=====
This project is under heavy development and is therefore not available on PyPi.
I would not expect major API breaks but certainly addition of functionality.

Installation
============
Currently it is only possible to install SymDet from source and it will remain
like this until it has been thoroughly tested on experimental data and a larger
number of symmetry groups.

Install from source
*******************

**pip installation**

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/SamTov/SymDet.git
   cd SymDet
   pip3 install . --user

**conda installation**

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/SamTov/SymDet.git
   cd SymDet
   conda create -n SymDet python=3.8
   conda activate SymDet
   pip3 install .

Documentation
*************

There is a live version of the documentation hosted
`here <https://symdet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Alternatively you can
build it from source using

.. code-block:: bash

   cd Symdet/docs
   make html

You can then browse the documentation locally using your favourite browser.

Getting started
===============

Because SymDet is not designed for single purpose, you will need to interface
with different libraries and classes directly. This isn't as bad as it sounds
and we have a number of tutorials to explain how this works. Broadly there
are two modules relevant to most analysis, these are the analysis and
generators modules.

* **analysis**: This module contains the necessary methods for analyzing raw
  data and extraction symmetry groups from it.
* **generators**: This module contains all of the modules necessary for
  extracting Lie group generators from the symmetry groups.
  
As a first step I would suggest looking at the
`examples <https://github.com/SamTov/SymDet/tree/main/examples>`_
directory and following along with some tutorials.

Comments
========
This is a really young project and any comments or contributions would be
welcome. If you see issues in the documentation (particularly if you're a
mathematician) I would always welcome the feedback.
