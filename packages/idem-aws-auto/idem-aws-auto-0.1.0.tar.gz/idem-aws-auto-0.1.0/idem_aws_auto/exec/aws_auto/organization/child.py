    **Autogenerated function**

    Lists all of the organizational units (OUs) or accounts that are contained in the specified parent OU or root. This operation, along with ListParents enables you to traverse the tree structure that makes up this root.  Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value when calling a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The NextToken response parameter value is null only when there are no more results to display.  This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.

    Args:
        parent_id(str): The unique identifier (ID) for the parent root or OU whose children you want to list. The regex pattern for a parent ID string requires one of the following:    Root - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.    Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.  .
        child_type(str): Filters the output to include only the specified child type.
        next_token(str, optional): The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a NextToken response in a previous request. A NextToken response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's NextToken response to indicate where the output should continue from. Defaults to None.
        max_results(int, optional): The total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the NextToken response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check NextToken after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Dict
