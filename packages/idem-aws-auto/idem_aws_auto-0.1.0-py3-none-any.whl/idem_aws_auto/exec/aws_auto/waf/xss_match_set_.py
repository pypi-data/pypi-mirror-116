     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.  For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Creates an XssMatchSet, which you use to allow, block, or count requests that contain cross-site scripting attacks in the specified part of web requests. AWS WAF searches for character sequences that are likely to be malicious strings. To create and configure an XssMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateXssMatchSet request.   Submit a CreateXssMatchSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateXssMatchSet request.   Submit an UpdateXssMatchSet request to specify the parts of web requests in which you want to allow, block, or count cross-site scripting attacks.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

    Args:
        name(str): A friendly name or description for the XssMatchSet that you're creating. You can't change Name after you create the XssMatchSet.
        change_token(str): The value returned by the most recent call to GetChangeToken.

    Returns:
        Dict

    Examples:
        Call from code:

        .. code-block:: python

            await hub.exec.aws_auto.waf.xss_match_set_.create(ctx, name=value, change_token=value)

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Permanently deletes an XssMatchSet. You can't delete an XssMatchSet if it's still used in any Rules or if it still contains any XssMatchTuple objects. If you just want to remove an XssMatchSet from a Rule, use UpdateRule. To permanently delete an XssMatchSet from AWS WAF, perform the following steps:   Update the XssMatchSet to remove filters, if any. For more information, see UpdateXssMatchSet.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a DeleteXssMatchSet request.   Submit a DeleteXssMatchSet request.

    Args:
        xss_match_set_id(str): The XssMatchSetId of the XssMatchSet that you want to delete. XssMatchSetId is returned by CreateXssMatchSet and by ListXssMatchSets.
        change_token(str): The value returned by the most recent call to GetChangeToken.

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Returns an array of XssMatchSet objects.

    Args:
        next_marker(str, optional): If you specify a value for Limit and you have more XssMatchSet objects than the value of Limit, AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response that allows you to list another group of XssMatchSets. For the second and subsequent ListXssMatchSets requests, specify the value of NextMarker from the previous response to get information about another batch of XssMatchSets. Defaults to None.
        limit(int, optional): Specifies the number of XssMatchSet objects that you want AWS WAF to return for this request. If you have more XssMatchSet objects than the number you specify for Limit, the response includes a NextMarker value that you can use to get another batch of Rules. Defaults to None.

     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.  For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Inserts or deletes XssMatchTuple objects (filters) in an XssMatchSet. For each XssMatchTuple object, you specify the following values:    Action: Whether to insert the object into or delete the object from the array. To change an XssMatchTuple, you delete the existing object and add a new one.    FieldToMatch: The part of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header or custom query parameter, the name of the header or parameter.    TextTransformation: Which text transformation, if any, to perform on the web request before inspecting the request for cross-site scripting attacks. You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.   You use XssMatchSet objects to specify which CloudFront requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, if you're receiving requests that contain cross-site scripting attacks in the request body and you want to block the requests, you can create an XssMatchSet with the applicable settings, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.  To create and configure an XssMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Submit a CreateXssMatchSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateIPSet request.   Submit an UpdateXssMatchSet request to specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

    Args:
        xss_match_set_id(str): The XssMatchSetId of the XssMatchSet that you want to update. XssMatchSetId is returned by CreateXssMatchSet and by ListXssMatchSets.
        change_token(str): The value returned by the most recent call to GetChangeToken.
        updates(List): An array of XssMatchSetUpdate objects that you want to insert into or delete from an XssMatchSet. For more information, see the applicable data types:    XssMatchSetUpdate: Contains Action and XssMatchTuple     XssMatchTuple: Contains FieldToMatch and TextTransformation     FieldToMatch: Contains Data and Type   .
