    **Autogenerated function**

    Lists parent objects that are associated with a given object in pagination fashion.

    Args:
        directory_arn(str): The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the Directory where the object resides. For more information, see arns.
        object_reference(Dict): The reference that identifies the object for which parent objects are being listed.
        next_token(str, optional): The pagination token. Defaults to None.
        max_results(int, optional): The maximum number of items to be retrieved in a single call. This is an approximate number. Defaults to None.
        consistency_level(str, optional): Represents the manner and timing in which the successful write or update of an object is reflected in a subsequent read operation of that same object. Defaults to None.
        include_all_links_to_each_parent(bool, optional): When set to True, returns all ListObjectParentsResponse$ParentLinks. There could be multiple links between a parent-child pair. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Dict
