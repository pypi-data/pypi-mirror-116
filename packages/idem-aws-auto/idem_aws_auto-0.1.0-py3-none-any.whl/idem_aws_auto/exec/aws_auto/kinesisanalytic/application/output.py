     This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation.  Adds an external destination to your Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. If you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to deliver data from an in-application stream within your application to an external destination (such as an Amazon Kinesis stream, an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS Lambda function), you add the relevant configuration to your application using this operation. You can configure one or more outputs for your application. Each output configuration maps an in-application stream and an external destination.  You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can analyze the errors. For more information, see Understanding Application Output (Destination).   Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current application version. For the limits on the number of application inputs and outputs you can configure, see Limits. This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:AddApplicationOutput action.

    Args:
        application_name(str): Name of the application to which you want to add the output configuration.
        current_application_version_id(int): Version of the application to which you want to add the output configuration. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the current application version. If the version specified is not the current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned. .
        output(Dict): An array of objects, each describing one output configuration. In the output configuration, you specify the name of an in-application stream, a destination (that is, an Amazon Kinesis stream, an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS Lambda function), and record the formation to use when writing to the destination.

    Returns:
        Dict

     This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation.  Deletes output destination configuration from your application configuration. Amazon Kinesis Analytics will no longer write data from the corresponding in-application stream to the external output destination. This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:DeleteApplicationOutput action.

    Args:
        application_name(str): Amazon Kinesis Analytics application name.
        current_application_version_id(int): Amazon Kinesis Analytics application version. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the current application version. If the version specified is not the current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned. .
        output_id(str): The ID of the configuration to delete. Each output configuration that is added to the application, either when the application is created or later using the AddApplicationOutput operation, has a unique ID. You need to provide the ID to uniquely identify the output configuration that you want to delete from the application configuration. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the specific OutputId. .
