PyImarisWriter is a python wrapper for the ImarisWriter library.

With this, it is possible to write ims files from python.

To get started, install the PyImarisWriter package and then run the example file from https://github.com/imaris/ImarisWriterTest/blob/master/testPy/PyImarisWriterExample.py

It is also possible to directly pass numpy arrays to PyImarisWriter. For certain numpy array types, the data can be written to ims files without any conversion.

The source of the python wrapper is available at https://github.com/imaris/ImarisWriter/tree/master/python/PyImarisWriter

Python sample code is available at https://github.com/imaris/ImarisWriterTest/tree/master/testPy
