        ## Usage
        
        You need to have webdrivers downloaded for it to work and give the program the path of the drivers. 
        
        ### To get search list:
        
        ```python
        from amazon_search_scraper_bc.scraper import AmazonScraper
        import os
        
        pwd = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())
        # Location of your webdriver Ex:
        path = pwd + "/webdrivers/chromedriver_linux64/chromedriver"
        
        # You can call or select which driver to use ['chrome', 'firefox'] it will open the browsers in headless mode.
        
        amasc =AmazonScraper("chrome", path)
        
        print(amasc.amazon_product_search("Mobile"))
        ```
        
        ### To get product details:
        
        ```python
        from amazon_search_scraper_bc.scraper import AmazonScraper
        import os
        
        pwd = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())
        
        # Location of your webdriver Ex:
        
        path = pwd + "/webdrivers/chromedriver_linux64/chromedriver"
        
        # You can call or select which driver to use ['chrome', 'firefox'] it will open the browsers in headless mode.
        
        amasc =AmazonScraper("chrome", path)
        
        url = "https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-9A-2GB-32GB-Storage/dp/B08696XB4B/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=mobile&qid=1629271762&sr=8-3"
        print(amazonSc.get_single_product_details(url))
        ```
        
        #### To change the amazon url 
        
        ```python
        from amazon_search_scraper_bc.scraper import AmazonScraper
        import os
        
        pwd = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())
        # Location of your webdriver Ex:
        path = pwd + "/webdrivers/chromedriver_linux64/chromedriver"
        # You can call or select which driver to use ['chrome', 'firefox'] it will open the browsers in headless mode.
        
        # By default it takes https://www.amazon.in .
        # When calling get_single_product_details you need to send full url.
        
        amasc =AmazonScraper("chrome", path, "https://www.amazon.com")
        ```
        
        #### To see the time it is taking
        
        ```python
        from amazon_search_scraper_bc.scraper import AmazonScraper
        import os
        
        pwd = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())
        # Location of your webdriver Ex:
        path = pwd + "/webdrivers/chromedriver_linux64/chromedriver"
        
        # You can call or select which driver to use ['chrome', 'firefox'] it will open the browsers in headless mode.
        
        amasc =AmazonScraper("chrome", path)
        
        # page_no needs to be greatter than 0
        
        page_no = 1
        time_show = True
        
        print(amasc.amazon_product_search("Mobile", page_no, time_show))
