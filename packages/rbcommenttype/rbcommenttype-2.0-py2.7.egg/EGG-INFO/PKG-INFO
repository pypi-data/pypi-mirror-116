Description: ===================================
        Review Board Comment Categorization
        ===================================
        
        This is an extension to `Review Board`_ that adds a new field when writing
        comments, allowing users to choose a category (such as security, performance,
        bug fixes, etc.) for a comment. This can help teams prioritize the type of
        feedback they give and address.

        Requirements
        ============
        
        The comment categorization extension requires Review Board 3.0 or newer.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install this extension, run::
        
            sudo pip install -U rbcommenttype
        
        If you're on Python 2.7 and previously installed using
        ``easy_install``, run::
        
            sudo easy_install -U rbcommenttype
        
        
        Once done, log in to Review Board's administration interface. Navigate to
        **Extensions**, select **Comment Categorization**, and click **Enable**.
        
        If you don't see this extension, reload/rescan your list of extensions.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The available categories are set in the extension's administration interface.
        From the extension list in the Review Board administration UI, click
        **Configure** to get to the extension configuration.
        
        If you want users to have to specify a comment type for every comment that they
        file, select **Require comment type**. If this is not selected, users can leave
        the field blank when making new comments.
        
        Below this is a table of the available type names. New types can be added by
        clicking **Add type**.
        
        Types can be removed by clicking the **X** to the right of the name, or hidden
        by un-checking the "Visible" check-box.
        
        Once changes have been made, click **Save** to update the configuration.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        When creating a new comment, the comment dialog will contain a new **Type**
        drop-down with the configured type names.
        
        The comment type saved with each comment can be seen next to the comment text,
        and is also available in the API (in the ``extra_data.commentType`` key in the
        various comment resources).
