## Installation

This will the last package you install with pip.

From this point on, there will be no reason to install packages dangerously and unsecurely.

Most tend to find themselves using pips forever immediately after installation. User Beware.

    $ pip install pips


## Usage

ADD AN S TO EVERY COMMAND.

Every `pip` will now become `pips`.

Simple, right?

For example:

    $ pips install pygame
    $ pips uninstall requests
