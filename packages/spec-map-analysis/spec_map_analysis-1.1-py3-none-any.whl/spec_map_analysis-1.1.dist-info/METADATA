## General Description

**Spec_map_analysis** is a spectral map analysis package. The package contains modules that allow for the fitting of emission lines in spectral maps, resampling and convolution of images, and derivation of emission line ratios and subsequently electron densities. 

 - The emission line fitting module can fit a single emission line with a Gaussian profile and optionally a polynomial continuum component. The spectral fitting is performed independently for each spatial pixel using a non-linear least squares method.

- The resampling and convolution module resamples one image to another image's pixel resolution, and then convolves either image to the specified spatial resolution. The convolution allows for the propagation of uncertainties, assuming they are correlated, using the method presented in [Klein (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abe8df). 

- The line ratio and electron density module allow for the derivation of specified line ratios and subsequently, electron density maps using atomic data from [PyNeb](http://research.iac.es/proyecto/PyNeb//). Aperture photometry can also be performed on the line intensity maps, and then used to calculate line ratios and electron densities for aperture regions.


## Requirements

**Spec_map_analysis** has the following requirements:
