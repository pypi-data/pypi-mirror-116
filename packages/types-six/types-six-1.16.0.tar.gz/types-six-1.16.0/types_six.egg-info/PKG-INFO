        This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `six` package.
        It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
        that uses `six`. The source for this package can be found at
        https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/six. All fixes for
        types and metadata should be contributed there.
        
        See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
        This package was generated from typeshed commit `6c41e3ceade4d00e73ae5cebeb20695a62ca41ae`.
