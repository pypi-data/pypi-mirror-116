# Create Your Own Bookfolding Patterns

This tool allows you to generate bookfolding patters from images.

Each color of pixels in the image must correspond to one fold depth in the
scuplture, with each horizontal pixel corresponding to one sheet of paper in
the book and each vertical pixel to one "measurement interval" along the edge
of the book.

If you use a traditional ruler, this measurement interval can be e.g. 1.0 mm,
corresponding to the spacing between the markings in the ruler, or if you feel
you can comfortably eyeball the midpoint between two markings, you can use 0.5
mm instead. For special tools, such as Incra rulers, the interval can be even
shorter.

If your pattern has less sheets than your book has pages, or the book you use
has pages without numbers, you can also set a custom start page for the
pattern, so that the first sheet in the pattern is e.g. page 5 or "page -3".


## Example

To create a pattern, you need a two-color image. The dimensions of the image
must be compatible with the book you intend to use: each horizontal pixel
corresponds to one sheet of paper in the book you are folding. You must also
ensure that the image is not too high for your book. In this example, we will
use [examples/hearts-342x315.png](hearts-342x315.png)).

The image is 342 pixels wide, so we'll need a book with at least 648 pages.
Let's assume that the book we intend to fold has 700 pages, meaning that there
will be a total of 8 sheets of paper in the book that do not belong to the
pattern. We want to divide them evenly so that the pattern sits in the middle
of the book, thus starting the pattern after the fourth sheet of paper in the
book. Thus, given that the book does not have unnumbered pages, the pattern
will start at page number 8.

Let's also assume that we are able to make the folds at 0.5 mm precision,
meaning that each vertical pixel in the pattern corresponds to 0.5 mm along the
edge of the book. This means that the height of the pattern along the edge of
the book is 15.75 cm, which fits nicely in our imaginary book that is 16 cm
high.

With this information, the pattern can be created using the command
```
bookfolder-cli --measurement-interval 0.5 --start-page 8 examples/hearts-342x315.png pdf-pattern examples/hearts.pdf
```
or by providing the corresponding information to the grapical version of the
program. The resulting pattern can be found in
[examples/hearts.pdf](examples/hearts.pdf).


## Requirements

This software has been tested on Python 3.6, but will likely run on other
versions of Python 3 too. If you use the graphical user interface, you also
need to have `python3-tkinter` installed.


## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) available on
   your system.
   - If you intend to use the graphical user interface, you also need  the
     `python3-tkinter` package
1. Download this tool either using `git clone` or the "Download ZIP" button
   found under the green "Code" menu. If you downloaded the tool as a zip,
   extract it.
1. Navigate to the directory to which you downloaded/extracted this tool.
1. Install the tool using pip:
    ```
    pip install .
    ```


## Usage

### Windowed mode

After installing, you can start the program with command `bookfolder`.

### Command-line use

See `bookfolder-cli --help` for information about available commands and their
invocation.
