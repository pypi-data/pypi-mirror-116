Description: # <span style="color:#4078c0">args_to_db</span> - An Argument Optimisation Data Generation Tool
        
        ```sh
            pip install args_to_db
        ```
        
        You want to analyze a (python) script for different arguments/settings? - Argument optimization is becoming more and more important in many application areas. <span style="color:#4078c0">args_to_db</span> is an attempt to generalize and simplify the process of running a programm in different modes or configurations and combining the resulting datasets to allow for further analysis.
        
        ## When should I use <span style="color:#4078c0">args_to_db</span>?
        You have a programm which is very general in its application, for example a solver framework for linear system of equations. This could look something like
        
        ```python
            python solver.py A b [--solver SOLVER] [--preconditioner PRECONDITIONER]
        ```
        
        Different inputs vary performance of solving methods dramatically. So we want to optimize the solver and preonditiner used for a specific linear system of equations.
        
        ## How do I use <span style="color:#4078c0">args_to_db</span>?
        
        So we want to compare different argument configurations. <span style="color:#4078c0">args_to_db</span> takes them in the array form:
        ```python
            argument_configurations = [['--solver', 'cg'],
                                       ['--solver', 'cg', '--preconditioner', 'jacobi'],
                                       ['--solver', 'lu']]
        ```
        
        And then we run all cases via:
        ```python
            args_to_db.run('solver.py', argument_configurations, threads=3)
        ```
        
        This spawns upto 3 concurrent processes each running the specified command. As complex applications are mostly reliant on argument optimisations, parallel execution is supported intuitively.
        
        ## Data collection
        We want to run the test cases individually and not inside a bigger (benchmarking) framework, but spawning different process yields the problem of data collection. Therfore the scripts internally log the results and <span style="color:#4078c0">args_to_db</span> handles combination of those later on.
        ```python
            args_to_db.add_result('solver_time', 20.3)
            args_to_db.add_result('solver_state', 'converged')
        
            args_to_db.write_results(__file__, args) # args currently is an argparse object
        ```
        This results in single file outputs of each script. Which are then combined into a single pandas dataframe after all simulations are completed.
