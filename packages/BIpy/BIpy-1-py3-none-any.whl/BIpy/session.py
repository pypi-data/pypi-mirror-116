class Session():
    """A class that handles the execution and data collection of a Psychopy experiment

    Attributes
    ----------
    info : dict or None
        Information about the session, ex: {'session_id': 1234}
    blocks : list of lists of functions
        List of blocks, each block a list of trials, each trial a function that takes exactly one input: 'logger'
        each trial function should execute the intended trial
    use_json : bool
        Flag to indicate whether or not to save data to json on calling save()
    to_hide : list
        List of trials to be ignored when saving to csv
    log_history : list of lists of dicts
        Used to store trial data on call of log()
    _iq : list
        Index queue, list of tuples corresponding to the indeces of each trial function in blocks
    


    Methods
    -------
    run
        Iterates through and runs all trial functions of blocks in order
    log(to_log: dict, save_to_file=True)
        Stores to_log in log_history[current_block_num][current_trial_num]
    hide_trial
        Marks current trial to be ignored when saving to csv
    save
        Attempts to find an apropriate filename, and calls save_to_csv(filename)
        if use_json is True, also calls save_to_json(filename)
    save_to_csv(filename)
        Saves the Session's info, and log_history to filename in csv format
    get_current
        Returns the current block and trial nuber
    save_to_json(filename)
        Saves as much information about the current Session object as possible to filename in json format
