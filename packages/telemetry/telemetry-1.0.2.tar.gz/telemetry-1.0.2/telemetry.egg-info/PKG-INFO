Description: 
        Remote measuring abstraction for software applications.
        
        `telemetry` serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various telemetry frameworks (e.g. pagerduty, slack, graphite) 
        allowing the end user to plug in the desired telemetry framework at deployment time. Think [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/)
        but for events and numbers.  This library borrows from their example (and copy.)
        
        As your projects grow, their telemetry requirements will change.  The purpose of this library is to simplify
        implementation, provide easy configuration, encourage testing, and avoid vendor lock.
        
        ## Supported Services:
        
        * pagerduty
        * slack
        
        Telemeters preference to being configurable, but don't require more than
        credentials to get working. For instance, slack can be implemented with
        the following:
        
        ```
        SLACK_ROOM_ID=Txxx/Byyy/Zzzz python
        import logging
        from telemetry import SlackTelemeter
        
        logging.getLogger().addHandler(SlackTelemeter())
        logging.info("hello room!")
        ```
