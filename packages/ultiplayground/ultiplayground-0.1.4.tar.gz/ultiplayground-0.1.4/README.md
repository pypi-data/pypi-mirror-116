Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
It is the first programming language I learned,
so I have quite a bit of experience with it.

To manage dependencies and build this package
I'm using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org),
and to test my functions [Pytest](https://pytest.org).
And if you are curious my code
editor is [Neovim](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/UltiVim).

Using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python/tree/main/.github/workflows)
every time that I push a commit, the project is analyzed using
[CodeQL](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)
and tested with
[PyTest](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python/blob/main/.github/workflows/pytest.yml).
Furthermore, every time I release a new version,
the package is automatically published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ultiplayground).

I do some exercises and challenges every day in:
