.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]showinfilemanager\f[R] opens the system file manager and optionally
selects files in it.
The point is not to \f[I]open\f[R] the files, but to \f[I]select\f[R]
them in the file manager, thereby highlighting the files and allowing
the user to quickly do something with them.

For file managers that do not support specifying files to select, this
program will instruct them to display the directory the file is found
in.
