A package that connects to a Fronius Symo device in the local network and provides data
that is provided via the JSON API of the Fronius Symo.
It is able to read the system and photovoltaic status.

The package supports the following data provided by fronius devices:

- Power Flow (System scope)
- Meter (System and Device scope)
- Inverter (System and Device scope)
- Storage (Device scope only) 
- Active Devices
- Logger Information

The package currently supportes the Fronius API V1 and V0.
Support may be enhanced based on the official documentation ([V1](https://www.fronius.com/~/downloads/Solar%20Energy/Operating%20Instructions/42%2C0410%2C2012.pdf), [V0](https://www.fronius.com/~/downloads/Solar%20Energy/Operating%20Instructions/42,0410,2011.pdf)).
Pull requests are very welcome.

I also know there are better scripts, yet they are not on pypi which is necessary
for using them with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)
