Levenshtein
===========

Introduction
------------

The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for fast
computation of:

* Levenshtein (edit) distance, and edit operations
* string similarity
* approximate median strings, and generally string averaging
* string sequence and set similarity

This is a fork of `ztane/python-Levenshtein <https://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein>`_, since the original
project is no longer actively maintained.

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.7 or later

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: bash
    pip install levenshtein
