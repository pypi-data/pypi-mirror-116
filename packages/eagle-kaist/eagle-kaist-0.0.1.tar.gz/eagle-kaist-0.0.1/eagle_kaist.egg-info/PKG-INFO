        ## Business Taxonomy
        There is a large number of companies in stock market. It is crucial to take a look over their financial reports and market indices to have a correct view of the companies' business status.
        
        In this section, we want to build several main groups of companies. Each group represents the area of business that the company is taking part in. In addition, we target to give a common credit score for each group, and also the rank of company in that group.
        
        * Input:
            - Stock indices
            - Companies financial reports
        
        * Output:
            - We want to have a comparison between the areas and give the advice on which business we should invest in.
            - We want to have a table that ranks companies and shows their potential in market.
