# SliQSim - A BDD-based Quantum Circuit Simulator

## Introduction
`SliQSim` is a BDD-based quantum circuit simulator implemented in C/C++ on top of [CUDD](http://web.mit.edu/sage/export/tmp/y/usr/share/doc/polybori/cudd/cuddIntro.html) package. In `SliQSim`, a bit-slicing technique based on BDDs is used to represent quantum state vectors. For more details of the simulator, please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09304).

## Build
To build the simulator, one needs to first configure `CUDD`:
```commandline
cd cudd
./configure --enable-dddmp --enable-obj --enable-shared --enable-static 
cd ..
```
Next, build the binary file `SliQSim`:
```commandline
make
```

## Execution
The circuit format being simulated is `OpenQASM` used by IBM's [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), and the gate set supported in this simulator now contains Pauli-X (x), Pauli-Y (y), Pauli-Z (z), Hadamard (h), Phase and its inverse (s and sdg), π/8 and its inverse (t and tdg), Rotation-X with phase π/2 (rx(pi/2)), Rotation-Y with phase π/2 (ry(pi/2)), Controlled-NOT (cx), Controlled-Z (cz), Toffoli (ccx and mcx), SWAP (swap), and Fredkin (cswap). One can find some example benchmarks in [examples](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/SliQSim/tree/master/examples) folder. 

For simulation types, we provide both weak and strong simulation options. The help message states the details:

```commandline
$ ./SliQSim --help
Options:
--help                produce help message
--sim_qasm arg        simulate qasm file string
--seed [=arg(=1)]     seed for random number generator
--print_info          print simulation statistics such as runtime,
                      memory, etc.
--type arg (=0)       the simulation type being executed.
                      0: weak simulation (default option) where the sampled 
                      outcome(s) will be provided after the simulation. The
                      number of outcomes being sampled can be set by argument
                      "shots" (1 by default).
                      1: strong simulation where the resulting state vector
                      will be shown after the simulation. Note that this
                      option should be avoided if the number of qubits is
                      large since it will result in extremely long runtime.
--shots arg (=1)      the number of outcomes being sampled, this argument is
                      only used when the simulation type is set to "weak"
```
For example, simulating [example/bell_state_measure.qasm](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/SliQSim/blob/master/examples/bell_state_measure.qasm), which is a 2-qubit bell state circuit with measurement gates at the end, with the weak simulation option can be executed by
```commandline
./SliQSim --sim_qasm examples/bell_state_measure.qasm --type 0 --shots 1024
```

Then the sampled results will be shown:
```commandline
{ "counts": { "11": 542, "00": 482 } }
```

If option `--print_info` is used, simulation statistics such as runtime and memory usage will also be provided: 
```commandline
  Runtime: 0.014433 seconds
  Peak memory usage: 12611584 bytes
  #Applied gates: 2
  Max #nodes: 13
  Precision of integers: 32
  Accuracy loss: 2.22045e-16
```

To demostrate the strong simulation, we use [example/bell_state.qasm](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/SliQSim/blob/master/examples/bell_state.qasm), which is the same circuit as in the weak simulation example except that the measurement gates are removed:
```commandline
./SliQSim --sim_qasm examples/bell_state.qasm --type 1
```

This will show the resulting state vector:
```commandline
{ "counts": { "00": 1 }, "statevector": ["0.707107", "0", "0", "0.707107"] }
```

One may also execute our simulator as a backend option of Qiskit through [SliQSim Qiskit Interface](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/SliQSim-Qiskit-Interface).
