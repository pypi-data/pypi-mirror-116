cafélytics ☕️
**************

A basic simulation of a coffee operation. Please pardon the mess as this is a work in progress.
This is a model that enables forecasting and experimentation under uncertainty, with the goal of steady year-over-year agricultural yields.
It can help address questions such as:

* *when should I expand / how much?*
* *what will the impacts of various crop diversification strategies be?*
* *how can I plan around disaster recovery and mitigation of lost income?*
* *what would cooperative-wide yields look like if more farmers joined? what about if some left?*


usage (python cli)
==================

The dataset provided can be used for forecasting with

.. code-block:: bash

   make run


which is equivalent to

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 simulate.py --farm data/fakeData.csv --years 75 --output testNewFarm.png


and will output this plot, representing the outputs of a collective of farmers over a seventy-five year time span:

Some farmers who joined the cooperative had trees that were already very mature, so this simulation starts back in 1991 to show their hypothetical contributions towards the total yield of the group (in other words, their membership start date is not considered as a factor in this simulation at this time).
