# colorwheels

An Endless Color Generator

This project is a continuous color generator for Python. We create a palette of a specific color range, a palette of matching colors and similar to serve to a consumer application. 

Works great when generating rainbow effects in hobby electronics (RGB LEDs, RGB Panels), and elsewhere. The idea behind is an endless colorwheel for photographers - the wheel continuously turns around to generate the next color.

Here's an example of colorwheels on a keybow, waiting for a keypress.

![keybow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantumspaces/colorwheels/0.7.2/img/keybow-colorwheels.gif)

All in a few lines of code:

```python

# wheel is initialized and definitions loaded or generated
while True:
    color = wheel.next()
    keybow.set_led(9, color[0], color[1], color[2])
    keybow.show()
    time.sleep(0.1)
```
