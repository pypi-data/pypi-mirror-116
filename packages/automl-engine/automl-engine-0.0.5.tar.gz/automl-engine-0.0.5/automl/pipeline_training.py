"""
This class is used to do training for different algorithms.

This will just contain the training logic here with both preprocessing and algorithm training to
produce already trained models and dump them.

So if we do need to get the models' best score and prediction, the best process is to load
the trained model from disk and do `transformation` and `prediction`. If we need to do test,
then frist we need to do transformation based on the processor and use the highest score model
to do `prediction`. One important thing here: 1. save the processor; 2. dump trained data; 3.
dump whole trained models.
