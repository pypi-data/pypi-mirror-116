Description: # py-handoff: Like Handoff, but in Python
        
        ## Usage
        On each Windows/MacOS/Linux devices connected to the same LAN, run the following command:
        ```
            pip install py-handoff
            py-handoff
        ```
        Now all you devices would share their clipboard.
        
        ## Optional Config
        ### Port
        By exporting "PY_HANDOFF_PORT=<port_number:int>", you can customize the port py-handoff used for communication.
        ### Secret Key
        Similarly, exporting "PY_HANDOFF_KEY=<secret_key:str>", you can customize the secret key py-handoff used to obfuscate its connections.
        
        Keep in mind that all py-handoff instances can only reconize and communicate with each other if and only if they have the same port number and the same secret key.
