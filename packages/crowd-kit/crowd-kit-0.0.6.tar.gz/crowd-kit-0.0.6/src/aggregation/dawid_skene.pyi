    Attributes:
        probas_ (typing.Optional[pandas.core.frame.DataFrame]): Tasks' label probability distributions
            A pandas.DataFrame indexed by `task` such that `result.loc[task, label]`
            is the probability of `task`'s true label to be equal to `label`. Each
            probability is between 0 and 1, all task's probabilities should sum up to 1

        priors_ (typing.Optional[pandas.core.series.Series]): A prior label distribution
            A pandas.Series indexed by labels and holding corresponding label's
            probability of occurrence. Each probability is between 0 and 1,
            all probabilities should sum up to 1

        labels_ (typing.Optional[pandas.core.frame.DataFrame]): Tasks' most likely true labels
            A pandas.Series indexed by `task` such that `labels.loc[task]`
            is the tasks's most likely true label.

        errors_ (typing.Optional[pandas.core.frame.DataFrame]): Performers' error matrices
            A pandas.DataFrame indexed by `performer` and `label` with a column for every
            label_id found in `data` such that `result.loc[performer, observed_label, true_label]`
            is the probability of `performer` producing an `observed_label` given that a task's
            true label is `true_label`
