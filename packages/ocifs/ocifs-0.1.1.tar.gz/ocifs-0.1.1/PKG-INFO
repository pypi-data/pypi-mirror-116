Description: # ocifs
        OCI Object Storage fsspec implementation
        
        Will move project to Oracle account once it's futher along, also we'll purge commit history prior to that move.
        
        ## Background:
        
        Pandas recently switched the underlying file system mechanism to read data to use a project called (fsspec)[https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec]. 
        
        `fsspec` implements an abstract file system. Reading a csv from s3 for example is handled by Pandas now because `s3://bucket/file` is understood by fsspec.  Similarly, Google /Microsoft/etc have added URI's for their own s3-like cloud storage offerings. Currently in `fsspec` there are the following URI handlers:
        
         - s3://... -> s3fs.S3FileSystem (requires pip install s3fs)
         - az://... -> adlfs.AzureBlobFileSystem (requires pip install adlfs)
         - dbfs://... -> fsspec.implementations.dbfs.DatabricksFileSystem (requires DataBricks)
         - gcs://...  -> gcsfs.GCSFileSystem (requires pip install gcsfs)
         - gdrive://... -> gdrivefs.GoogleDriveFileSystem (requires pip install gdrivefs)
         - Many more listed here: https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec/blob/master/fsspec/registry.py
        
        This project adds:
        
         - oci://... -> to do (through `pip install ocifs`)
        
        
        And the end result is that a user anywhere could run the following:
        
        ```pip install pandas fsspec ocifs
        df = pd.read_csv("ocifs://my_bucket/myobject.csv")```
