A useful tools to search a list of peptides in a fasta file (a list of proteins, or a proteome)

# Description
    
This tool consists one module:

- `PeptideSearch`: this tool searches for peptides in a fasta file including proteins, 
it can find Exact Match or Marches with up to One Mismatch 

# Installation
 
## Normal installation

```bash
pip install PeptidesSearch
```

## Upgrade installation
```bash
pip install PeptidesSearch --upgrade
```

## Development installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khaledianehdieh/PeptidesSearch.git
```

## Usage

```
python3
>>> from PeptideSearch import PeptideSearch as PS 
>>> P=PS.PeptideSearch(Peptides, Fasta_File) 
#Peptides is a List or a .txt file that has one peptide per line,
#and Fasta_File is a fasta file containing the proteins


#you might use the function as you need in three different ways:

#1- Find Exact Matches
>>> df_EM, pList= P.ExactMatch() #or df_EM, pList= P.ExactMatch(List_of_Peptides)
# returns all Exact Matches (df_EM) for each peptide and a list of 
#peptides (pList) that didn't find any


#2- Find One MisMatches
>>> peptides= P.read_Peptides()
df_OM, NotFoundList= P.OneMismatch(peptides) 
#returns all One  Mis Matches (df_OM) for each peptide 
#and list of peptides (NotFoundList) that couldn't find any match.


#3- Combine 1 and 2, first find a list of exacxt matches and then look 
#for one mismatch for the peptides that we didn't find any match

>>> df_all, NotFounPeptides = P.MatchFinder()   
#returns All Matches (df_all) including exact matches, and one mismatched 
#for each peptide and a list of peptides (NotFounPeptides) that couldn't 
#find any match. This part first applies the exact match, and if there is 
#not any exact match for a peptide, then it looks for one mismatch. 
#Also saves the result in a CSV file

#4- Find a peptide in one sequence
result,index=PS.PeptideSearch.SequenceSearch(peptide, sequence) 
# result=0 means exact match, result= 1 means one mismatch,  result= -1 
# means no match, and index is the start location of the peptide in the sequence.

```
