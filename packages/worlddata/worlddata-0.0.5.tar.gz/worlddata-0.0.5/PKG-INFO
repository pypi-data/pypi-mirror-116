Description: ## WorldData.AI
        Python API wrapper for [WorldData.AI](https://worlddata.ai)
        
        ### Installation
        - From pypi:
        `pip3 install worlddata`
        - From GitHub:
        Clone our repository and `python3 setup.py install` Or `pip install git+https://github.com/worlddata-ai/python-api.git`
          
        
        ### Requirements
        - [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)
        
        ### Usage
        ```python
        from pprint import pprint
        from worlddata.worlddata import WorldData
        
        worlddata = WorldData(auth_token = '1212312-12312312')
        pprint(worlddata.search(search_text = 'worlddata'))
        ```
        
        #### Connection pooling
        If you are going to make a couple of request, you can user connection pooling provided by `requests`. This will save significant time by avoiding re-negotiation of TLS (SSL) with the chat server on each call.
        
        ```python
        from requests import sessions
        from pprint import pprint
        from worlddata.worlddata import WorldData
        
        with sessions.Session() as session:
            worlddata = WorldData(auth_token = '1212312-12312312')
            pprint(worlddata.search('worlddata'))
        ```
         
        
        ### Method parameters
        Only required parameters are explicit on the WorldData class but you can still use all other parameters. For a detailed parameters list check the [WorldData.AI](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5099717/TzRa6jAj)
        
        ### API coverage
        Most of the API methods are already implemented. If you are interested in a specific call just open an issue or open a pull request.
        
        ### Tests
        We are actively testing :) 
        
        ### Contributing
        You can contribute by doing Pull Requests. (It may take a while to merge your code but if it's good it will be merged). Please, try to implement tests for all your code and use a PEP8 compliant code style.
        
        Reporting bugs and asking for features is also contributing ;) Feel free to help us grow by registering issues.
        
        We hang out [here](WorldData.AI) if you want to talk.
