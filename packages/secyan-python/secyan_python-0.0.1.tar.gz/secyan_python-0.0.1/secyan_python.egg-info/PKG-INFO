# Requirements

## For Debian Linux

- build-essential (gcc >= 8)
- cmake >= 3.12
- libssl-dev
- libgmp-dev
- libboost-all-dev (Boost >= 1.66)

## For macOS

- brew install cmake
- brew install openssl
- brew install gmp
- brew install boost
- brew install pybind11

CMAKE-flag -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl -DOPENSSL_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib

# Run the example in Docker

First install docker on your local machine, and then in the main folder, run

```bash
docker-compose build dev
```

```bash
dokcer-compose up dev
```

And now you can ssh into the container like

```
ssh user@localhost -p 2222
```

# Configure and Compile

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Aqua-Dream/SECYAN
cd SECYAN
mkdir Release
cd Release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j 8
```

# Run Demo

Switch to the output folder `Release/src/example`.

```bash
# Server

# Run Benchmark

Switch to the output folder `Release/src/example`.

```bash
> ./benchmark
Usage: ./benchmark
 -r [Role: 0/1, default: 0 (SERVER), required]
 -a [IP-address, default: 127.0.0.1, optional]
 -p [Port (will use port & port+1), default: 7766, optional]
 -n [Number of test runs, default: 3, optional]
 -q [Query ID (3,10,18,8,9,0), default: 0, i.e. test all queries. , optional]

Program exiting
> ./benchmark -r 0 -p 7706 > result_server.txt &
> ./benchmark -r 1 -p 7706 -q 3> result_client.txt &
```

# Remark

- SECYAN only read the last 8 digits of string from data file. For example, the the first row of column `c_name` in `customer.tbl` is `Customer#000000001`, but it will be outputted as `00000001`.
- To use your own data, please refer to the format of files under `data` folder. SECYAN currently cannot generate annotations automatically. You need to write the annotation columns on your own.
- To run your own query, please refer to the file `data/TPCH.cpp`. SECYAN currently cannot generate codes from SQL automatically. You need to rewrite your query into combinations of operators (`Aggregation`,`SemiJoin`,`Join`,etc.).
