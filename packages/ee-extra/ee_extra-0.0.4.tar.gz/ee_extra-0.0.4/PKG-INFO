Overview
-------------------

`Google Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com/>`_ is a cloud-based service for geospatial processing of vector and raster data. The Earth Engine platform has a `JavaScript and a Python API <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides>`_ with different methods to process geospatial objects. Google Earth Engine also provides a `HUGE PETABYTE-SCALE CATALOG <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/>`_ of raster and vector data that users can process online (e.g. Landsat Missions Image Collections, Sentinel Missions Image Collections, MODIS Products Image Collections, World Database of Protected Areas, etc.). 

There are a lot of fantastic third-party GEE packages and projects around GitHub. However, most of them are coded in JavaScript or in a Python code style that is not straightforward to translate to R, Julia, or other programming languages. The main goal of **ee_extra** is to guarantee a smooth import of these projects. We re-wrote the most popular JavaScript and Python EE algorithms minimizing the dependencies to just two Python packages: **earthengine-api** and **NumPy**. Third-party GEE tools that can not meet this stipulation will not be added to **ee_extra**. Additionally, rigorous checking of code style (**black**) and documentation style (**darglint**) will be carried out to guarantee a smooth conversion of Python documentation into, for instance, R documentation (**rgee::ee_help**).

Google Earth Engine Community: Developer Resources
-----------------------------------------------------

The ee_extra Python package can be found indirectly in the `Earth Engine Community: Developer Resources <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/developer-resources>`_ as the powerhouse of `eemont <https://github.com/davemlz/eemont>`_, `rgee <https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee>`_ and `rgeeExtra <https://github.com/r-earthengine/rgeeExtra>`_.


Powerhouse of...
--------------------
