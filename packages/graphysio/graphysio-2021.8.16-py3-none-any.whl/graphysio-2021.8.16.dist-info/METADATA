# GraPhysio
GraPhysio is a graphical time series visualizer created for physiologic
data signals from ICU patient monitors. It is however not limited to this.
It currently supports reading from CSV files.
It can handle low frequency and high frequency data as well as aggregating
and synchronizing signals from different sources.
GraPhysio supports basic mathematical operations and filters and can help
selecting and exporting time periods.
Performance is good depending on your hardware for files up to 1 GB.
