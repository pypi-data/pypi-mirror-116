Description: # k1lib
        
        PyTorch is awesome, and it provides a very effective way to execute ML code fast. What it lacks is surrounding infrastructure to make general debugging and discovery process better. Other more official wrapper frameworks sort of don't make sense to me, so this is an attempt at recreating a robust suite of tools that makes sense.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Just do this:
        
        ```bash
        pip install k1lib
        ```
        
        If you only care about the bioinformatics side of this, and don't want anything to do with deep learning, then do this:
        
        ```bash
        pip install --no-deps k1lib
        ```
