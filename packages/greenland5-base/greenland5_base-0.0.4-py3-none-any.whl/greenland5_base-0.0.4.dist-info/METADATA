# Greenland5 Base Package
## About

'greenland5-base' provides foundational features that need to be
available to every Greenland5 package and interfaces (hooks) into
installed Greenland5 packages. Currently this is mostly a commandline
interface - 'greenland' - that allows to execute the built-in self
tests via 'greenland bist'.

## Future Plans

- Factor out runtime for commandline interfaces (mainly the subcommand
  registry) and make it available via the (future) 'greenland.cmdline'
  package. See Stories/cmdline-runtime-exposed.org.

## How to Contribute

- Fork the project on gitlab
  (https://gitlab.com/m-e-leypold/greenland5-base), then set a merge
  request. Please clean up your changeset (squashing, rebasing,
  rewriting the commit messages) before setting the merge request.

- Report bugs at gitlab.

We're currently not providing a way to submit pull-requests per mail
or requesting merges from repositories outside of gitlab. This might
come in the future when community contributions become significant.

You can try to send patches to the maintainer e-mail address, but we
strongly prefer at the moment that you use gitlab.
