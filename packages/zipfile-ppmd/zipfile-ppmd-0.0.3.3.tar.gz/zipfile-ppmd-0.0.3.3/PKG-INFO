        # zipfile-ppmd
        [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/zipfile-ppmd)](https://pypi.org/project/zipfile-ppmd/)
        
        Monkey patch the standard `zipfile` module to enable PPMd support.
        
        Based on [`zipfile-deflate64`](https://github.com/brianhelba/zipfile-deflate64) and [`zipfile-zstandard`](https://github.com/taisei-project/python-zipfile-zstd), which provides similar functionality but for the `deflate64` algorithm. Unlike `zipfile-deflate64`, this package supports both compression and decompression.
        
        Requires [`pyppmd`](https://github.com/miurahr/pyppmd) for ppmd bindings. Note that 0.16.0+ is required, which is not released yet. Please do `python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/miurahr/pyppmd`.
        
        Note: if you need Python2, use [zipfile39](https://github.com/cielavenir/zipfile39) instead (it is also compatible with Python3).
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install zipfile-ppmd
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Anywhere in a Python codebase:
        ```python
        import zipfile_ppmd  # This has the side effect of patching the zipfile module to support PPMd
        ```
        
        Alternatively, `zipfile_ppmd` re-exports the `zipfile` API, as a convenience:
        ```python
        import zipfile_ppmd as zipfile
        
        zipfile.ZipFile(...)
        ```
        
        Compression example:
        ```python
        import zipfile_ppmd as zipfile
        
        zf = zipfile.ZipFile('/tmp/test.zip', 'w', zipfile.ZIP_PPMD, compresslevel=5)
        zf.write('large_file.img')
        ```
