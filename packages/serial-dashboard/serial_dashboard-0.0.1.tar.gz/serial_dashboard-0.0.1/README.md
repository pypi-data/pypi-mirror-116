# serial-dashboard

This package provides a browser-based dashboard as a Python replacement for the serial plotter and serial monitor of the Arduino IDE. It includes extra utilities, such as plotting of a time axis (as opposed to strictly sample number), ability to save data transferred over serial, and ability to start and stop streams.
