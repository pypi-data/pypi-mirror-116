        =============================================================================
        Login with OAuth2/ OpenId by integrating Authomatic in Plone
        =============================================================================
        
        **pas.plugins.authomatic**
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Provides OAuth2 and OpenID login capability for Plone:
        
        It integrates the awesome `Authomatic <http://authomatic.github.io/authomatic/reference/providers.html>`_ package in Plone
        
          Authomatic is a framework agnostic library
          for Python web applications
          with a minimalistic but powerful interface
          which simplifies authentication of users
          by third party providers like Facebook or Twitter
          through standards like OAuth and OpenID.
        
          *by Author Peter Hudec on Authomatic website*
        
        It has out of the box support for:
        
        OAuth 1.0a providers
            Bitbucket, Flickr, Meetup, Plurk, Twitter, Tumblr, UbuntuOne, Vimeo, Xero, Xing and Yahoo.
        OAuth 2.0 providers
            Amazon, Behance, Bitly, Cosm, DeviantART, Eventbrite, Facebook, Foursquare, GitHub, Google, LinkedIn, PayPal, Reddit, Viadeo, VK, WindowsLive, Yammer and Yandex.
        OpenID
            python-openid and Google App Engine based OpenID.
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        - This package will create a view called ``authomatic-handler`` where you can login with different providers
        - The view can be used as well to add an identity from a provider to an existing account
        - The provider is choosen in the URL so if you call ``/authomatic-handler/PROVIDER`` you will use PROVIDER to login
        - You can set the JSON configuration of the plugin in the Controlpanel ``@@authomatic-controlpanel`` (linked under users)
        - Example JSON configuration (first level key is the PROVIDER::
        
            {
                "github": {
                    "display": {
                        "title": "Github",
                        "cssclasses": {
                            "button": "plone-btn plone-btn-default",
                            "icon": "glypicon glyphicon-github"
                        },
                        "as_form": false
                    },
                    "propertymap": {
                        "email": "email",
                        "link": "home_page",
                        "location": "location",
                        "name": "fullname"
                    },
                    "class_": "authomatic.providers.oauth2.GitHub",
                    "consumer_key": "5c4901d141e736f114a7",
                    "consumer_secret": "d4692ca3c0ab6cc1f8b28d3ccb1ea15b61e7ef5c",
                    "access_headers": {
                        "User-Agent": "Plone Authomatic Plugin"
                    }
                },
            }
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install pas.plugins.authomatic by adding it to your buildout::
        
           [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                pas.plugins.authomatic
        
        
        and then running "bin/buildout".
        
        Start Plone and activate the plugin in the addons control-panel.
        
        Go to the Authomatic controlpanel (security section) and configure the plugin.
        
        Configuration parameters for the different authorization are provided as JSON text in there.
        JSON is used because of flexibility.
        Details at `Authomatics provider section <http://peterhudec.github.io/authomatic/reference/providers.html>`_.
        
        There are some differences in configuration:
        
        - the value of ``"class_"`` has to be a string, which is then resolved as a dotted path.
        - each provider can get an optional entry ``display`` with sub-enties such as:
        
          - ``title`` which is used in the templates instead of the section name.
          - ``iconclasses`` which is applied in the templates to an span.
          - ``buttonclasses`` which is applied in the templates to the button.
          - ``as_form`` (true/false) which renders a form for OpenId providers.
        
        - each provider can get an optional entry ``propertymap``.
          It is a mapping from authomatic/provider user properties to plone user properties, like ``"fullname": "name",``.
          Look at each providers documentation which properties are available.

        Development
        -----------
        
        You need a working ``python`` environment (system, virtualenv, pyenv, etc) version 3.7 or superior.
        
        Then you should install some requirements with pip::
        
            > bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        And finally run buildout::
        
            > bin/buildout -N
        
        By default we use the last Plone version (5.2).

        - Make the whole ``remember`` procedure a ``safeWrite`` if called from login
          view. We can not pass a authenticator token here, because of redirects and
          expected return urls .
          [jensens]
        
        - Allow selection of user id generator strategy.
          [jensens]

        - Use authomatic.core.User attributes instead of raw provider data. closes `#9`_
          [ericof]
        
        
        1.0a1 (2015-10-28)

        - Initial release.
