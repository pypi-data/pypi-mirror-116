               Excitatory neurons have been thought to be the only source of

               This population of projecting GABAergic neurons comprises both
               somatostatin-positive (SOM+) and parvalbumin-positive (PV+)
               neurons that target direct and indirect pathway striatal output
               neurons as well as cholinergic interneurons differentially.
               Notably, optogenetic stimulation of M1 PV+ and M2 SOM+

               To address these issues, we used a task in which rats decide
               when to abort waiting for a delayed tone. We recorded neurons in
               the secondary motor cortex (M2) and interpreted our findings in
               light of an integration-to-bound decision model. A first
               population of M2 neurons ramped to a constant threshold at rates
               proportional to waiting time, strongly resembling integrator

               the integrator, fired in sequences and showed trial-to-trial
               rate fluctuations correlated with waiting times. An integration
               model fit to these data also quantitatively predicted the

  author    = "Gremel, Christina M and Costa, Rui M",
  abstract  = "Shifting between motor plans is often necessary for adaptive
               behavior. When faced with changing consequences of one's
               actions, it is often imperative to switch from automatic actions
               to deliberative and controlled actions. The pre-supplementary
               motor area (pre-SMA) in primates, akin to the premotor cortex
               (M2) in mice, has been implicated in motor learning and
               planning, and action switching. We hypothesized that M2 would be
               differentially involved in goal-directed actions, which are
               controlled by their consequences vs. habits, which are more
               dependent on their past reinforcement history and less on their
               consequences. To investigate this, we performed M2 lesions in
               mice and then concurrently trained them to press the same lever
               for the same food reward using two different schedules of
               reinforcement that differentially bias towards the use of
               goal-directed versus habitual action strategies. We then probed
               whether actions were dependent on their expected consequence
               through outcome revaluation testing. We uncovered that M2
               lesions did not affect the acquisition of lever-pressing.
               However, in mice with M2 lesions, lever-pressing was insensitive
               to changes in expected outcome value following goal-directed
               training. However, habitual actions were intact. We confirmed a
               role for M2 in goal-directed but not habitual actions in
               separate groups of mice trained on the individual schedules
               biasing towards goal-directed versus habitual actions. These
               data indicate that M2 is critical for actions to be updated
               based on their consequences, and suggest that habitual action
               strategies may not require processing by M2 and the updating of

              through its output projections to target areas. The primary (MOp)
              and secondary (MOs) motor cortices are known to produce specific
              output projections that are targeted to both similar and
              different target areas. These projections are further divided
              into layer 5 and 6 neuronal outputs, thereby producing four
              cortical outputs that may target other areas in a combinatorial
              manner. However, the precise network structure that integrates
              these four projections remains poorly understood. Here, we
              constructed a whole-brain, three-dimensional (3D) map showing the

              areas to treat PD symptoms, although also known to alleviate
              motor disturbances in PD. We were able to show that optogenetic
              activation of secondary (M2) motor cortex improves motor
              functions in dopamine-depleted male mice. The stimulated M2
              cortex harbors glutamatergic pyramidal neurons that project to
              subcortical structures, critically involved in motor control, and
              makes synaptic contacts with dopaminergic neurons. Strikingly,
              optogenetic activation of M2 neurons or axons into the
              dorsomedial striatum increases striatal levels of dopamine and
              evokes locomotor activity. We found that dopamine
              neurotransmission sensitizes the locomotor behavior elicited by
              activation of M2 neurons. Furthermore, combination of intranigral
              infusion of glutamatergic antagonists and circuit specific
              optogenetic stimulation revealed that behavioral response
              depended on the activity of M2 neurons projecting to SNc.
              Interestingly, repeated M2 stimulation combined with l-DOPA
              treatment produced an unanticipated improvement in working memory
              performance, which was absent in control mice under l-DOPA

              critical for the assembly of the motor and cognitive function,
              and this study demonstrates a therapeutic mechanism for cortical
              stimulation in PD that involves recruitment of long-range

              patients with Parkinson's disease are offered treatment through
              surgery, which consists of delivering electrical current to
              regions deep within the brain. This study shows that stimulation
              of an area located on the brain surface, known as the secondary
              motor cortex, can also reverse movement disorders in mice.
              Authors have used a brain stimulation technique called
              optogenetics, which allowed targeting a specific type of surface
              neuron that communicates with the deep part of the brain involved
              in movement control. The study also shows that a combination of
              this stimulation with drug treatment might be useful to treat
              memory impairment, a kind of cognitive problem in Parkinson's

              including the determination of one's position and direction in

              the perceived location of the goal of the movement. In this
              review, we propose that while limbic areas are important for the
              sense of spatial orientation, the posterior parietal cortex is
              responsible for relating this sense with the location of a
              navigational goal and in formulating a plan to attain it. Hence,
              the posterior parietal cortex is important for the computation of
              the correct trajectory or route to be followed while navigating.
              Prefrontal and motor areas are subsequently responsible for
              executing the planned movement. Using this theory, we are able to
              bridge the gap between the rodent and primate literatures by
              suggesting that the allocentric role of the rodent PPC is largely
              analogous to the egocentric role typically emphasized in

              potential goals in the planning of goal-directed movements.",

              of the cells exhibited movement-related activity that

              right turns, and forward motion. Correlates ranged from strong
              excitation (relative to the still condition) to strong

              variety of different ways. For example, cells that discriminated
              between clockwise and counterclockwise turns did so with either
              antagonistic responses or simple excitation or inhibition. Others

              in defensive action selection has been elucidated, top-down
              modulation of brainstem locomotor circuitry remains unclear. Here
              we provide evidence for the existence and functionality of a
              monosynaptic connection from the central amygdala (CeA) to the
              mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) that inhibits locomotion in

              that locomotion stimulated by airpuff coincides with increased
              activity of MLR glutamatergic neurons. Using retrograde tracing
              and ex vivo electrophysiology, we find that the CeA makes a
              monosynaptic connection with the MLR. In the open field, in vivo
              stimulation of this projection suppressed spontaneous locomotion,
              whereas inhibition of this projection had no effect. However,
              inhibiting CeA terminals within the MLR increased both neural

              conditioned avoidance paradigm known to activate CeA neurons, we
              find that inhibition of the CeA projection increased successful
              escape, whereas activating the projection reduced escape.

               However, in contrast to humans, the destruction of cortex and
               its descending fibers has been thought not to cause remarkable
               deficits in simple locomotion in quadropedal animals. In the
               present study, we aimed to investigate in detail how lesion of
               the sensorimotor cortex affected locomotion ability in mice
               using the KinemaTracer system, a novel video-based kinematic
               analyzer. We found that traumatic injury to the left
               sensorimotor cortex induced several apparent deficits in the
               movement of contralesional right limbs during treadmill
               locomotion. The step length of right limbs decreased, and the
               speed in the forward direction was abrogated in the swing phase.
               The coordinates and angle of each joint were also changed after
               the injury. Some of the abnormal values in these parameters
               gradually recovered near the control level. The number of
               cFos-expressing neurons following locomotion significantly
               decreased in the right side of the spinal cord in injured mice,
               suggesting a role for cortex and descending fibers in
               locomotion. In contrast, interlimb coordination did not change
               remarkably even after the injury, supporting the notion that the
               basic locomotor pattern was determined by intraspinal neural
               circuits. These results indicate that the motor cortex and its

              of V2a neurons of the rostral medulla stops ongoing locomotor

              superior colliculus (SC), the downstream cells and circuits that
              engage adequate motor actions have remained elusive. Furthermore,
              the mechanisms supporting trajectory changes are still
              speculative. Here, using transneuronal viral tracings in mice, we
              show that brainstem V2a neurons, a genetically defined subtype of
              glutamatergic neurons of the reticular formation, receive
              putative synaptic inputs from the contralateral SC. This makes
              them a candidate relay of lateralized orienting commands. We next
              show that unilateral optogenetic activations of brainstem V2a
              neurons in vivo evoked ipsilateral orienting-like responses of
              the head and the nose tip on stationary mice. When animals are
              walking, similar stimulations impose a transient locomotor arrest
              followed by a change of trajectory. Third, we reveal that these
              distinct motor actions are controlled by dedicated V2a subsets

              (1) a lumbar-projecting subset whose unilateral activation
              specifically controls locomotor speed but neither impacts
              trajectory nor evokes orienting movements, and (2) a
              cervical-projecting subset dedicated to head orientation, but not
              to locomotor speed. Activating the latter subset suffices to
              steer the animals' directional heading, placing the head
              orientation as the prime driver of locomotor trajectory. V2a
              neurons and their modular organization may therefore underlie the

                   reverse engineering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to
                   identify and elucidate contextual processing. We apply these
                   methods to understand RNNs trained on sentiment
                   classification. This analysis reveals inputs that induce
                   contextual effects, quantifies the strength and timescale of
                   these effects, and identifies sets of these inputs with
                   similar properties. Additionally, we analyze contextual
                   effects related to differential processing of the beginning
                   and end of documents. Using the insights learned from the
                   RNNs we improve baseline Bag-of-Words models with simple
                   extensions that incorporate contextual modification,
                   recovering greater than 90\% of the RNN's performance
                   increase over the baseline. This work yields a new
                   understanding of how RNNs process contextual information,
                   and provides tools that should provide similar insight more

              MLR ) is increasingly considered as a target to improve locomotor
              function in Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury and stroke. A
              key function of the MLR is to control the speed of forward
              symmetrical locomotor movements. However, the ability of freely
              moving mammals to integrate environmental cues to brake and turn
              during MLR stimulation is poorly documented. Objective/hypothesis
              We investigated whether freely behaving mice could brake or turn
              based on environmental cues during MLR stimulation. Methods We
              stimulated the cuneiform nucleus in mice expressing
              channelrhodopsin in Vglut2-positive neurons in a Cre-dependent
              manner (Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP) using optogenetics. We detected
              locomotor movements using deep learning. We used patch-clamp
              recordings to validate the functional expression of
              channelrhodopsin and neuroanatomy to visualize the stimulation
              sites. Results Optogenetic stimulation of the MLR evoked
              locomotion and increasing laser power increased locomotor speed.
              Gait diagram and limb kinematics were similar during spontaneous
              and optogenetic-evoked locomotion. Mice could brake and make
              sharp turns (∼90⁰) when approaching a corner during MLR
              stimulation in an open-field arena. The speed during the turn was
              scaled with the speed before the turn, and with the turn angle.
              In a reporter mouse, many Vglut2-ZsGreen neurons were
              immunopositive for glutamate in the MLR. Patch-clamp recordings
              in Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP mice show that blue light evoked short
              latency spiking in MLR neurons. Conclusion MLR glutamatergic
              neurons are a relevant target to improve locomotor activity
              without impeding the ability to brake and turn when approaching
              an obstacle, thus ensuring smooth and adaptable navigation.

               development of topological data analysis (TDA), which models

               (matrix) methods or cluster analysis. TDA represents the shape
               of the data (suitably defined) in a combinatorial fashion.
               Methods for measuring shape have been developed within
               mathematics, providing a toolkit referred to as homology. In

              ``tangling'': moments where similar activity patterns led to
              dissimilar future patterns. Avoidance of tangling was present
              across tasks and species. Network models revealed a potential
              reason for this consistent feature: low tangling confers noise
              robustness. Finally, we were able to predict motor cortex
              activity from muscle activity by leveraging the hypothesis that
              muscle-like commands are embedded in additional structure that
              yields low tangling.",

               Even for simple tasks, a detailed understanding of how recurrent
               networks work, or a prescription for how to develop such an
               understanding, remains elusive. In this work, we use tools from
               dynamical systems analysis to reverse engineer recurrent

               foundational natural language processing task. Given a trained
               network, we find fixed points of the recurrent dynamics and

  author   = "Walker, Michael and Mason, Georgia",
  abstract = "Voluntary wheel running occurs in mice of all strains, sexes, and
              ages. Mice find voluntary wheel running rewarding, and it leads
              to numerous health benefits. For this reason wheels are used both
              to enhance welfare and to create models of exercise. However,
              many designs of running wheel are used. This makes between-study
              comparisons difficult, as this variability could potentially
              affect the amount, pattern, and/or intensity of running
              behaviour, and thence the wheels' effects on welfare and
              exercise-related changes in anatomy and physiology. This study
              therefore evaluated two commercially available models, chosen
              because safe for group-housed mice: Bio Serv\textregistered{}'s
              ``fast-trac'' wheel combo and Ware Manufacturing Inc.'s stainless
              steel mesh 5″ upright wheel. Working with a total of three
              hundred and fifty one female C57BL/6, DBA/2 and BALB/c mice, we
              assessed these wheels' relative utilization by mice when access
              was free; the strength of motivation for each wheel-type when
              access required crossing an electrified grid; and the impact each
              wheel had on mouse well-being (inferred from acoustic startle
              responses and neophobia) and exercise-related anatomical changes
              (BMI; heart and hind limb masses). Mice ran more on the
              ``fast-trac'' wheel regardless of whether both wheel-types were
              available at once, or only if one was present. In terms of
              motivation, subjects required to work to access a single wheel
              worked equally hard for both wheel-types (even if locked and thus
              not useable for running), but if provided with one working wheel
              for free and the other type of wheel (again unlocked) accessible
              via crossing the electrified grid, the ``fast-trac'' wheel
              emerged as more motivating, as the Maximum Price Paid for the
              Ware metal wheel was lower than that paid for the ``fast-trac''
              plastic wheel, at least for C57BL/6s and DBA/2s. No deleterious
              consequences were noted with either wheel in terms of health and
              welfare, but only mice with plastic wheels developed
              significantly larger hearts and hind limbs than control animals
              with locked wheels. Thus, where differences emerged, Bio
              Serv\textregistered{}'s ``fast-trac'' wheel combos appeared to

              advances in the genetic identification of spinal and supraspinal
              circuits important to locomotion in the mouse, it is now
              important to get a better understanding of the full repertoire of
              gaits in the freely walking mouse. To assess this range, young
              adult C57BL/6J mice were trained to walk and run on a treadmill
              at different locomotor speeds. Instead of using the classical
              paradigm defining gaits according to their footfall pattern, we
              combined the inter-limb coupling and the duty cycle of the stance
              phase, thus identifying several types of gaits: lateral walk,
              trot, out-of-phase walk, rotary gallop, transverse gallop, hop,
              half-bound, and full-bound. Out-of-phase walk, trot, and
              full-bound were robust and appeared to function as attractor
              gaits (i.e., a state to which the network flows and stabilizes)
              at low, intermediate, and high speeds respectively. In contrast,
              lateral walk, hop, transverse gallop, rotary gallop, and
              half-bound were more transient and therefore considered
              transitional gaits (i.e., a labile state of the network from
              which it flows to the attractor state). Surprisingly, lateral
              walk was less frequently observed. Using graph analysis, we

  abstract = "We analysed treadmill locomotion of the adult SWISS-OF1 mice over
              a large range of velocities. The use of a high-speed video camera
              combined with cinefluoroscopic equipment allowed us to quantify
              in detail the various space and time parameters of limb
              kinematics. We find that velocity adjustments depend upon whether
              animal used a symmetrical or non-symmetrical gait. In symmetrical
              gaits, the increase of velocity generally results equally from an
              increase in the stride frequency and the stride length. On the
              other hand, in non-symmetrical gaits, the increase in velocity is
              achieved differently according to the level of velocity used. As
              speed increases, velocity increases first as a consequence of
              increased stride frequency, then as in symmetrical gaits, by an
              equal increase in both variables, and finally at high speed,
              velocity increases through increased stride length. In both
              symmetrical and non-symmetrical gaits, stance and swing-time
              shortening contributed to the increase of the stride frequency,
              with stance time decrease being the major contributor. The

  author   = "Walter, Rebecca M",
  abstract = "Turning is a requirement for locomotion on the variable terrain
              that most terrestrial animals inhabit and is a deciding factor in
              many predator-prey interactions. Despite this, the kinematics and
              mechanics of quadrupedal turns are not well understood. To gain
              insight to the turning kinematics of small quadrupedal mammals,
              six adult wild mice were videotaped at 250 Hz from below as they
              performed 90 degrees running turns. Four markers placed along the
              sagittal axis were digitized to allow observation of lateral
              bending and body rotation throughout the turn. Ground contact
              periods of the fore- and hindlimbs were also noted for each
              frame. During turning, mice increased their ground contact time,
              but did not change their stride frequency relative to straight
              running at maximum speed. Postcranial body rotation preceded
              deflection in heading, and did not occur in one continuous
              motion, but rather in bouts of 15-53 degrees. These bouts were
              synchronized with the stride cycle, such that the majority of
              rotation occurred during the second half of forelimb support and
              the first half of hindlimb support. In this phase of the stride
              cycle, the trunk was sagittally flexed and rotational inertia was
              65\% of that during maximal extension. By synchronizing body
              rotation with this portion of the stride cycle, mice can achieve
              a given angular acceleration with much lower applied torque.
              Compared with humans running along curved trajectories, mice
              maintained relatively higher speeds at proportionately smaller
              radii. A possible explanation for this difference lies in the
              more crouched limb posture of mice, which increases the
              mechanical advantage for horizontal ground force production. The
              occurrence of body rotation prior to deflection in heading may
              facilitate acceleration in the new direction by making use of the
              relatively greater force production inherent in the parasagittal
              limb posture of mice.",

              equipment. The sequences of locomotion were analysed to determine
              the various space and time parameters of limb kinematics. We
              found that velocity adjustments are accounted for differently by
              the stride frequency and the stride length if the animal showed a
              symmetrical or an asymmetrical gait. In symmetrical gaits, the
              increase of velocity is provided by an equal increase in the
              stride length and the stride frequency. In asymmetrical gaits,
              the increase in velocity is mainly assured by an increase in the
              stride frequency in velocities ranging from 15 to 29 cm s(-1).
              Above 68 cm s(-1), velocity increase is achieved by stride length
              increase. In velocities ranging from 29 to 68 cm s(-1), the
              contribution of both variables is equal as in symmetrical gaits.
              Both stance time and swing time shortening contributed to the

              major contribution from stance time decrease. The pattern of

  author   = "Fiker, Robert and Kim, Linda H and Molina, Leonardo A and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gait analysis forms a critical part of many lab
              workflows, ranging from those interested in preclinical
              neurological models to others who use locomotion as part of a
              standard battery of tests. Unfortunately, while paw detection can
              be semi-automated, it becomes generally a time-consuming process
              with error corrections. Improvement in paw tracking would aid in
              better gait analysis performance and experience. NEW METHOD: Here
              we show the use of Visual Gait Lab (VGL), a high-level software
              with an intuitive, easy to use interface, that is built on
              DeepLabCut™. VGL is optimized to generate gait metrics and allows
              for quick manual error corrections. VGL comes with a single
              executable, streamlining setup on Windows systems. We demonstrate
              the use of VGL to analyze gait. RESULTS: Training and evaluation
              of VGL were conducted using 200 frames (80/20 train-test split)
              of video from mice walking on a treadmill. The trained network
              was then used to visually track paw placements to compute gait
              metrics. These are processed and presented on the screen where
              the user can rapidly identify and correct errors. COMPARISON WITH
              EXISTING METHODS: Gait analysis remains cumbersome, even with
              commercial software due to paw detection errors. DeepLabCut™ is
              an alternative that can improve visual tracking but is not
              optimized for gait analysis functionality. CONCLUSIONS: VGL
              allows for gait analysis to be performed in a rapid, unbiased
              manner, with a set-up that can be easily implemented and executed

  abstract = "BACKGROUND Obtaining a complete phenotypic characterization of a
              freely moving organism is a difficult task, yet such a
              description is desired in many neuroethological studies. Many
              metrics currently used in the literature to describe locomotor
              and exploratory behavior are typically based on average
              quantities or subjectively chosen spatial and temporal
              thresholds. All of these measures are relatively coarse-grained
              in the time domain. It is advantageous, however, to employ
              metrics based on the entire trajectory that an organism takes
              while exploring its environment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
              To characterize the locomotor behavior of Drosophila
              melanogaster, we used a video tracking system to record the
              trajectory of a single fly walking in a circular open field
              arena. The fly was tracked for two hours. Here, we present
              techniques with which to analyze the motion of the fly in this
              paradigm, and we discuss the methods of calculation. The measures
              we introduce are based on spatial and temporal probability
              distributions and utilize the entire time-series trajectory of
              the fly, thus emphasizing the dynamic nature of locomotor
              behavior. Marginal and joint probability distributions of speed,
              position, segment duration, path curvature, and reorientation
              angle are examined and related to the observed behavior.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The measures discussed in this paper
              provide a detailed profile of the behavior of a single fly and
              highlight the interaction of the fly with the environment. Such
              measures may serve as useful tools in any behavioral study in
              which the movement of a fly is an important variable and can be
              incorporated easily into many setups, facilitating
              high-throughput phenotypic characterization.",

               to descending tracts. Glutamate antagonists block mesencephalic
               locomotor region-induced and spontaneous locomotion, and
               glutamatergic agonists induce locomotion in spinal animals. NA
               and 5-HT inputs to the spinal cord originate in the brainstem,
               while the descending dopaminergic pathway originates in the
               hypothalamus. Agonists acting at NA, DA or 5-HT receptors
               facilitate or induce locomotion in spinal animals. 5-HT neurons
               located in the parapyramidal region (PPR) produce locomotion
               when stimulated in the isolated neonatal rat brainstem-spinal
               cord preparation, and they constitute the first anatomically
               discrete group of spinally-projecting neurons demonstrated to be
               involved in the initiation of locomotion in mammals. Neurons in
               the PPR are activated during treadmill locomotion in adult rats.
               Locomotion evoked from the PPR is mediated by 5-HT(7) and
               5-HT(2A) receptors, and 5-HT(7) antagonists block locomotion in
               cat, rat and mouse preparations, but have little effect in mice
               lacking 5-HT(7) receptors. 5-HT induced activity in 5-HT(7)
               knockout mice is rhythmic, but coordination among flexor and
               extensor motor nuclei and left and right sides of the spinal
               cord is disrupted. In the adult wild-type mouse, 5-HT(7)
               receptor antagonists impair locomotion, producing patterns of
               activity resembling those induced by 5-HT in 5-HT(7) knockout
               mice. 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists have a reduced effect on
               locomotion in adult 5-HT(7) receptor knockout mice. We conclude
               that the PPR is the source of a descending 5-HT command pathway
               that activates the CPG via 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(2A) receptors.

               The region was named Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR). Since

               various vertebrate species, including the lamprey, salamander,
               stingray, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit or monkey. In human subjects

              spontaneous behavioural responses in the mouse represents a
              powerful approach to study how the mammalian brain processes
              sensory information and selects appropriate motor actions. For
              visually and auditory guided behaviours the relevant action has
              been empirically identified as a change in locomotion state.
              However, the extent to which locomotion alone captures the
              diversity of those behaviours and their sensory specificity is
              unknown.To tackle this problem we developed a method to obtain a
              faithful 3D reconstruction of the mouse body that enabled us to
              quantify a wide variety of movements and changes in postures.
              This higher dimensional description of behaviour revealed that
              responses to different sensory inputs is more stimulus-specific
              than indicated by locomotion data alone. Thus, equivalent
              locomotion patterns evoked by different stimuli (e.g. looming and
              sound evoking locomotion arrest) could be well separated along
              other dimensions. The enhanced stimulus-specificity was explained
              by a surprising diversity of behavioural responses. A clustering
              analysis revealed that distinct combinations of motor actions and
              postures, giving rise to at least 7 different behaviours, were
              required to account for stimulus-specificity. Moreover, each
              stimulus evoked more than one behaviour revealing a robust
              one-to-many mapping between sensations and behaviours that could
              not be detected from locomotion data.Our results challenge the
              current view of visually and auditory guided behaviours as purely
              locomotion-based actions (e.g. freeze, escape) and indicate that
              behavioural diversity and sensory specificity unfold in a higher

               treated as black boxes: their mechanism of operation remains

               stable and unstable, and the linearized dynamics around them,
               can reveal crucial aspects of how RNNs implement their
               computations. Further, we explore the utility of linearization
               in areas of phase space that are not true fixed points but
               merely points of very slow movement. We present a simple
               optimization technique that is applied to trained RNNs to find
               the fixed and slow points of their dynamics. Linearization
               around these slow regions can be used to explore, or

              It is typically conceptualized as opposing habit-based behaviors,
              which are instead supported by stimulus-response associations and
              insensitive to consequences. The prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL)
              is positioned along the medial wall of the rodent prefrontal
              cortex. It is indispensable for action-outcome-driven
              (goal-directed) behavior, consolidating action-outcome

              model complex cognitive and motor tasks performed by behaving
              animals. RNNs are trained to reproduce animal behavior while also
              capturing key statistics of empirically recorded neural activity.
              In this manner, the RNN can be viewed as an in silico circuit
              whose computational elements share similar motifs with the
              cortical area it is modeling. Furthermore, because the RNN's
              governing equations and parameters are fully known, they can be
              analyzed to propose hypotheses for how neural populations
              compute. In this context, we present important considerations
              when using RNNs to model motor behavior in a delayed reach task.
              First, by varying the network's nonlinear activation and rate
              regularization, we show that RNNs reproducing single-neuron
              firing rate motifs may not adequately capture important
              population motifs. Second, we find that even when RNNs reproduce
              key neurophysiological features on both the single neuron and
              population levels, they can do so through distinctly different
              dynamical mechanisms. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we
              show that an RNN consistent with a previously proposed dynamical
              mechanism is more robust to input noise. Finally, we show that
              these dynamics are sufficient for the RNN to generalize to tasks
              it was not trained on. Together, these results emphasize
              important considerations when using RNN models to probe neural

              neural network (RNN) may resemble empirical single-unit activity
              but not adequately capture important features on the neural
              population level. Dynamics of RNNs can be visualized in
              low-dimensional projections to provide insight into the RNN's
              dynamical mechanism. RNNs trained in different ways may reproduce
              neurophysiological motifs but do so with distinctly different
              mechanisms. RNNs trained to only perform a delayed reach task can
