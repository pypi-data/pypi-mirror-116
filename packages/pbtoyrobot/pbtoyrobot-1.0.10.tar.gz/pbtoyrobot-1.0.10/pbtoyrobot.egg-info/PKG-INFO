Description: ## PBTOYROBOT: Toy Robot CLI
        
        A CLI to control a toy robot.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install using pip:
        
            pip install pbtoyrobot
        
        
        CLI
        ---
        
        - The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
        - There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
        - The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement
          that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still
          be allowed.
          
        ```plain
            # Show help
            pbtoyrobot --help
        
            # PLACE: Places the robot at X, Y with orientation F
            # Possible value for x and y are integers between 0 and 5 included
            # Possible values for F are NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST
            pbtoyrobot PLACE 1,1,NORTH
        
            # MOVE: Moves the robot of one unit in the current direction
            pbtoyrobot MOVE
            
            # LEFT: Rotates the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction
            pbtoyrobot LEFT
        
            # RIGHT: Rotates the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction
            pbtoyrobot RIGHT
        
            # REPORT: will announce the X,Y and orientation of the robot
