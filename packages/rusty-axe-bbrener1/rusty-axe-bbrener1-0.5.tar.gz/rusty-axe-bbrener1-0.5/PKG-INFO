# Rusty Axe

## Analyzing nested structure in data using unsupervised random forests.

This package is intended to interface with one or two numpy matrices of a large size (>100 samples, >10 features), and decomposes said matrices into random forest factors (RFFs) that describe different effects at different levels of nesting and non-linear dependency. It generates HTML reports that describe the underlying data, and can also generate other kinds of feedback. This package additionally can train on one dataset and compare that dataset to another. 

For a more complete description of available functions please see the tutorial under ./tutorial

This package is currently intended to be run on linux or osx. This package may funciton on windows but no guarantees are made. 

## Installation

Please note, before installing you will need python <= 3.8 (this is due to a compatibility issue with statsmodels in pypi and a fix is forthcoming) and a rust compiler in the environment in which you wish to install. 

A rust compiler can be obtained and silently installed by executing 

`curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y`

If you wish to alter any aspect of the rust compiler defaults, you can execute 

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

or simply check the current recommendations at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Installation is currently by 

`pip -install rusty_axe_bbrener1.tar.gz`

of the sdist tarball file located in this repo under /dist. 

Alternatively, if you wish to clone this repo, 

`python setup.py`

executed while in the repo directory should also do the trick. 

A conda installer is forthcoming, as is a pypi upload.
