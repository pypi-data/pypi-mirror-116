Welcome to BOTLIB, a pure python3 IRC chat bot library

INSTALL
=======

installation is through pypi::

 $ sudo pip3 install botlib 

if you want to bot to start after reboot::

 $ sudo cp /usr/local/share/botlib/botd.service /etc/systemd/system
 $ sudo systemctl enable botd --now

default channel/server is #botd on localhost.

CONFIG
======

you can configure the bot with the cfg command, it edits files on disk::

 $ bot cfg server=botd.io channel=\#botd nick=botd

note: use can use botctl instead of bot to control the background daemon.

if you need to login with SASL run the pwd command first and use that to
configure a password::

 $ bot pwd <nick> <password>
 $ bot cfg password=<outputofpwd>

if the users option is set in the irc config then users need to be added 
before they can give commands::

 $ bot cfg users=true 

use the met command to introduce a user::

 $ bot met ~bart@botd.io
 ok

COMMANDS
========

modules are not loaded from a directory but included in the code itself, so
if you want to program you need to clone the repositry from github::

 $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/bthate/botlib

or download a tar from pypi::

 $ https://pypi.org/project/botlib/#files

open bot/hlo.py (new file) and add the following code::

    def hlo(event):
        event.reply("hello %s" % event.origin)

and add the hlo module to bot/all.py::

   import bot.hlo


the hlo command in now available::

 <bart> !hlo
 hello root@console

RSS
===

BOTD doesn't depend on other software so running rss is optional, you need
to install feedparser seperately::

 $ sudo apt install python3-feedparser

add an url use the rss command with an url::

 $ bot rss https://github.com/bthate/botd/commits/master.atom
 ok

run the fnd (find) command to see what urls are registered::

 $ bot fnd rss
 0 https://github.com/bthate/botd/commits/master.atom

the ftc (fetch) command can be used to poll the added feeds::

 $ bot ftc
 fetched 20

UDP
===

there is also the possibility to serve as a UDP to IRC relay where you
can send UDP packages to the bot and have txt displayed in the channel.
output to the IRC channel is done with the use python3 code to send a UDP
packet to BOTD, it's unencrypted txt send to the bot and displayed in the
joined channels::

 import socket

 def toudp(host=localhost, port=5500, txt=""):
     sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
     sock.sendto(bytes(txt.strip(), "utf-8"), host, port)

to have the udp relay running, add udp to modules to load at start of the
program::

 m = "bot.irc,bot.rss,bot.udp"

PROGRAMMING
===========

the bot package provides a library you can use to program objects 
under python3. It provides a basic Object, that mimics a dict while using 
attribute access and provides a save/load to/from json files on disk. objects
can be searched with a little database module, it uses read-only files to
improve persistence and a type in filename for reconstruction.

basic usage is this::

 >>> from bot.obj import Object
 >>> o = Object()
 >>> o.key = "value"
 >>> o.key
 'value'

objects try to mimic a dictionary while trying to be an object with normal
attribute access as well. hidden methods are provided as are the basic
methods like get, items, keys, register, set, update, values.

the bot.obj module has the basic methods like load/save to disk providing bare
persistence::

 >>> wd = "data"
 >>> from bot.obj import Object
 >>> o = Object()
 >>> o["key"] = "value"
 >>> p = o.save()
 >>> p
 'bot.obj.Object/4b58abe2-3757-48d4-986b-d0857208dd96/2021-04-12/21:15:33.734994
 >>> oo = Object()
 >>> oo.load(p)
 >> oo.key
 'value'

great for giving objects peristence by having their state stored in files.
