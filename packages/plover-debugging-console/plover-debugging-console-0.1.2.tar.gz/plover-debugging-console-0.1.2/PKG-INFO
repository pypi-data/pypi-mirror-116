Description: # plover-debugging-console
        A IPython debugging console for Plover.
        
        See also:
        
        * [`plover-run-py` plugin](https://github.com/user202729/plover-run-py) for
        executing a Python command with a stroke, or from the command-line.
        
        ### Usage
        
        * Install the plugin.
        * Enable the extension plugin in Plover.
        * Run the command `plover-debugging-console-connect` (or `plover -s plover-debugging-console-connect`)
        in a terminal.
        
        The global variable `engine` is given. Other objects can be accessed from `engine` as public
        or private members.
        
        Alternatively, `plover-debugging-console-connect qtconsole` can be used to launch a console-style application using Qt.
        See documentation of `jupyter qtconsole` for more details.
        
        ### Note
        
        * Once started, the kernel is not stopped until Plover exits.
        * Any `print` commands are printed on Plover's console, not IPython's console.
        * On some operating systems, the plugin may set `PAGER` environment variable. (see [issue #2 of `plover-run-shell` repository](https://github.com/user202729/plover_run_shell/issues/2))
        
        ### Implementation details
        
        * The kernel can be connected to manually with `ipython console --existing <file>`
        or `jupyter console --existing <file>`.
        * The IPython/Jupyter connection file path is stored in `connection_path_container`, which is
        `plover_debugging_console_path` in the temp folder in the current version.
        * `background_zmq_ipython` package is used, which requires `jupyter`
