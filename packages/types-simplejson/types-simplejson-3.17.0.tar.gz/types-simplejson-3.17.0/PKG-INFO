Description: ## Typing stubs for simplejson
        
        This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `simplejson` package.
        It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
        that uses `simplejson`. The source for this package can be found at
        https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/simplejson. All fixes for
        types and metadata should be contributed there.
        
        See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
        This package was generated from typeshed commit `e415a7fad8c962ff950d9416600e16d028baa2ca`.
