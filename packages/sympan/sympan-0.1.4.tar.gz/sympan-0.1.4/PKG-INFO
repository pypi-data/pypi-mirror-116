Description: ## sympan - Python library for downloading data from S3
        
        This is a simple Python library for downloading any content from S3, locally.
        It is based on boto3 and joblib. It is really a simple library,
        but it is very useful. It uses parallel programming in Python,
        as well as boto3.client and boto3.resource. 
        
        ## Installation
        Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed.
        
        ```bash install.sh``` will do the job.
        
        ```
        pip install sympan
        
        ```
        
        will also do the job if you don't want to clone it first.
        
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        ```
        
        from sympan.handlers import S3Handler
        
        from credentials import (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                                 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
                                 REGION_NAME)
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            s3 = S3Handler(aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                           aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
                           region_name=REGION_NAME)
        
            s3.download_locally(s3_url= "s3://url/path/to/folder/or/file/",
                                destination_folder="local/path/to/destination/folder",
                                n_jobs=2)
        ```
        Here credentials.py is a file where you 
        need to put your AWS credentials. The structure in 
        destination folder will be the same as in S3 url. Try it!:)
